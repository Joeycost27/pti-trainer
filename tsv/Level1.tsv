1	YES	Fungi	Brown rot fungi primarily weaken trees by removing which structural component?	Lignin	Cellulose & hemicellulose	Starch reserves	Tannins	1	Brown rot fungi break down cellulose and hemicellulose leaving lignin relatively intact	This produces cubical cracking rapid brittleness and severely reduced bending strength. Trees fail suddenly without warning signs	Fenton reaction-based enzymes break down cellulose chains; lignin remains as brown residue creating characteristic color.<br>Fracture pattern: Cubical cracking due to cellulose loss - wood loses tensile strength but retains some compression capacity.<br>Mechanical effect: Rapid loss of bending strength - wood snaps rather than bends. Dangerous because failure is sudden.<br>Common species: Laetiporus sulphureus Fomitopsis pinicola Phaeolus schweinitzii Serpula lacrymans		
2	YES	Fungi	White rot typically causes structural problems because it:	Removes lignin first	Only affects deadwood	Targets bark tissues only	Strengthens reaction wood	0	White rot fungi preferentially break down lignin the polymer providing compression strength	This leaves fibrous pale spongy wood with reduced rigidity and resilience. Failure is often more gradual than brown rot but still dangerous	Lignin peroxidases and other oxidative enzymes break down complex lignin polymers; cellulose may follow later.<br>Appearance: Pale cream/white color fibrous texture stringy or spongy consistency may feel damp.<br>Mechanical effect: Loss of compression strength and rigidity; wood becomes flexible before failing. Types: Simultaneous or selective.<br>Common species: Ganoderma spp. Armillaria spp. Meripilus giganteus Pleurotus ostreatus Fomes fomentarius		
3	YES	Fungi	Soft rot progression is most often associated with:	Dry well-aerated wood	Waterlogged or persistently wet conditions	Low pH soils only	Freezing temperatures	1	Soft rot occurs in wet oxygen-poor environments and produces narrow cavities in the secondary cell wall	It progresses more slowly than brown/white rot but can still compromise structural integrity over time especially in ground-contact situations	Conditions: High moisture content above fibre saturation low oxygen often in ground contact or submerged timber.<br>Mechanism: Type 1 soft rot forms cavities within secondary cell wall; Type 2 erodes cell wall from lumen.<br>Appearance: Surface softening may look sound internally initially.<br>Progression: Slower than brown/white rot.<br>Hosts: Common in fence posts poles timbers in ground contact waterlogged archaeology cooling towers		
4	YES	Fungi	Which symptom is most diagnostic of Armillaria infection?	Bleeding cankers	White mycelial fans beneath the bark	Black tarry exudates	Epicormic clusters in the crown	1	Armillaria forms distinct white mycelial fans between bark and wood	Rhizomorphs spread through soil but mycelial fans are THE definitive diagnostic feature - if you see them it's Armillaria	Diagnostic signs: White/cream mycelial sheets under bark at root collar and lower stem - this is the GOLD STANDARD for diagnosis.<br>Black rhizomorphs in soil or under bark.<br>Honey-coloured toadstools in autumn but not always present.<br>Decay type: White rot of roots and root collar.<br>Spread: Root-to-root contact rhizomorph growth through soil.<br>Species: A. mellea most pathogenic A. gallica less aggressive A. ostoyae A. cepistipes A. tabescens.<br>Risk: Root plate failure windthrow - HIGH HAZARD		
5	YES	Fungi	Ganoderma root and butt decay commonly results in:	Longitudinal splitting with increased flexibility	Loss of lateral stability and potential windthrow	Crown dieback as the first consistent sign	Immediate brittle stem failure	1	Ganoderma species attack buttress and root tissues reducing anchorage capacity	The tree becomes vulnerable to windthrow before obvious crown decline appears. Root and butt decay is HIDDEN until advanced - external symptoms often minimal	Decay type: White rot with simultaneous lignin and cellulose degradation.<br>Target location: Roots root collar lower 1-2m of stem.<br>Signs: Perennial brackets at base may be absent in early stages zonate upper surface brown spore deposit wood becomes spongy/fibrous.<br>Species in UK: G. australe most common G. applanatum G. resinaceum G. pfeifferi.<br>Failure mode: WINDTHROW - tree uproots because anchorage is compromised.<br>Risk assessment: Root inspection essential		
6	YES	Fungi	Kretzschmaria deusta Brittlestem is most dangerous because:	It produces visible conks early	It creates a hard brittle decay with no external symptoms	It only colonises dead roots	It improves stem taper	1	Kretzschmaria deusta often develops internal brittle decay with minimal external indicators	Failure is sudden and catastrophic often without warning. Fruiting bodies may not appear until decay is VERY advanced. One of the most dangerous decay fungi	Decay type: Soft rot causing unique brittle ceramic-like fracture.<br>Danger: Extensive internal decay with minimal or no external signs until very late stage.<br>Late-stage signs: Grey powdery patches at base turning black and crusty but often absent.<br>Fracture: Wood becomes extremely brittle - snaps like pottery/ceramic.<br>Hosts: Beech primary sycamore horse chestnut ash especially stressed by ash dieback.<br>Assessment: Sounding resistograph drilling or tomography ESSENTIAL.<br>Risk: VERY HIGH - sudden catastrophic failure		
7	YES	Fungi	Which factor most significantly increases the likelihood of fungal colonisation?	Dry summer conditions	Wounding that exposes sapwood	High nitrogen fertiliser	Shallow leaf litter	1	Most decay fungi require exposed sapwood to colonise	Mechanical wounds pruning cuts root damage and soil grade changes create entry points. Intact bark is the tree's primary defence barrier	Primary routes: Wounds mechanical damage animal damage pruning cuts and branch stubs root damage from excavation/construction bark injuries from impacts soil grade changes exposing roots branch failures creating torn surfaces.<br>Why sapwood matters: Living sapwood provides moisture and nutrients fungi need to establish.<br>CODIT response: Trees compartmentalise wounds using 4-wall system but barriers can be breached.<br>Prevention: Proper pruning technique avoid root zone disturbance protect bark remove branch stubs promptly avoid soil level changes near trunk		
8	YES	Fungi	Where do most decay fungi initiate infection in a tree?	The cambium layer	The pith	The heartwood-sapwood boundary	The outer bark	2	The heartwood-sapwood boundary is a biologically inactive zone that offers favourable moisture and oxygen conditions for decay fungi	This transition zone has optimal conditions - heartwood extractives but no active defence adequate moisture suitable oxygen levels. Decay often establishes here before spreading	Why this location: Transition zone between living sapwood and dead heartwood. Balance of moisture/oxygen ideal for fungal establishment.<br>Heartwood characteristics: No living cells contains extractives that resist some fungi drier than sapwood provides structural support.<br>Sapwood characteristics: Living parenchyma cells active defence mechanisms higher moisture transports water and nutrients.<br>Decay progression: Often colonises boundary first then spreads inward to heartwood AND outward toward sapwood		
9	YES	Fungi	Which description best fits the progression of a white-rot fungus in a living tree?	Rapid collapse of outer sapwood	Compartmentalisation prevents all spread	Gradual delignification producing a flexible fibrous decay	Only affects dead wood	2	White rot produces fibrous flexible pale decay as lignin breaks down	Spread varies with species but typically gradual. Can significantly weaken compression strength over years. Tree often compartmentalises but doesn't always stop progression	Rate variation: Highly species-dependent. Aggressive species progress quickly; slower species may take decades.<br>Pattern: Often follows wound columns may be compartmentalised by CODIT walls.<br>Appearance: Wood progressively loses lignin becomes paler more fibrous/stringy may feel spongy.<br>Detection: Sounding gives soft thud response; probing reveals fibrous texture.<br>Tree response: May produce compensatory growth around decayed zones		
10	YES	Fungi	The presence of rhizomorphs bootlaces indicates:	Fomes fomentarius	Armillaria spp.	Ganoderma spp.	Phaeolus schweinitzii	1	Rhizomorphs are characteristic of Armillaria and allow long-distance spread between hosts through soil	These black/brown cord-like structures can travel several metres through soil spreading infection from tree to tree. They can survive in soil for years and are extremely resilient	Structure: Multicellular fungal roots with protective melanised outer layer inner conducting tissue.<br>Function: Spread through soil independently of host contact can travel 3-5+ metres infect new hosts when they contact roots survive adverse conditions store energy reserves.<br>Identification: Black/dark brown branching round in cross-section bootlace appearance found under bark at root collar OR in soil near infected trees.<br>Species note: A. tabescens does NOT form rhizomorphs.<br>Management: Nearby trees at risk. Removal of infected stump/roots recommended		
11	YES	Fungi	Meripilus giganteus primarily compromises tree stability by decaying:	Upper crown scaffold branches	Lower stem sapwood	Structural roots and the root plate	Shoots and fine twigs	2	Meripilus aggressively attacks structural roots undermining the anchorage system	Trees may fail by windthrow with little crown symptom. Root plate assessment is CRITICAL - the decay is hidden underground until advanced	Common name: Giant Polypore.<br>Decay type: White rot attacking roots and root collar - rarely extends into stem above ground.<br>Location: Structural roots buttress roots root plate.<br>Signs: Large rosette-forming brackets at tree base multiple caps overlapping brown bruising when touched short-lived brackets brown spore deposit. May be absent in early infection.<br>Hosts: Beech primary also oak horse chestnut lime sweet chestnut.<br>Failure mode: WINDTHROW - tree uproots.<br>Assessment: Probe root plate excavate to inspect roots pulling tests tomography of root collar		
12	YES	Fungi	In trees with central stem decay which failure mode is most likely?	Bending failure around defects	Root plate uplift only	Torsional cracking only	Sudden crown snap without stem deformation	0	Central decay reduces the section modulus making stem vulnerable to bending failure	The outer shell carries most bending stress - if adequate thickness remains tree can be stable. But if shell is thin asymmetric or has openings bending failure likely under wind load	Engineering principle: Most bending stress occurs at outer fibres. Centre contributes little to bending strength so hollowness doesn't automatically mean failure.<br>Critical factor: Residual wall thickness ratio t/R. Wall thickness divided by radius. Below 0.3 is concerning; below 0.2 is high risk.<br>Section modulus: Mathematical measure of bending resistance.<br>Complications: Openings/wounds concentrate stress asymmetric decay creates uneven wall thickness.<br>Assessment tools: Sounding increment borer resistograph tomography.<br>Failure mode: Shell cracks under bending stress crack propagates stem snaps at weakest point		
13	YES	Fungi	Which decay is most associated with brittle snap-like failure?	Brown rot	White rot	Soft rot	Bark canker rot	0	Brown rot removes cellulose causing rapid loss of tensile strength and brittle snapping	Results in sudden failure rather than ductile bending. Wood snaps like chalk or pottery with minimal warning. VERY DANGEROUS because failure is catastrophic and unpredictable	Why brown rot is brittle: Cellulose provides tensile strength. When removed only brittle lignin remains. Wood cannot flex or bend - it snaps.<br>Characteristic fracture: Cubical cracking pattern clean breaks sharp edges wood crumbles to powder no fibrous texture.<br>Comparison: White rot is more ductile - pulls apart in fibres gives warning. Brown rot gives NO warning.<br>Brown rot fungi: Laetiporus sulphureus Phaeolus schweinitzii Fomitopsis pinicola Serpula lacrymans.<br>Also brittle: Kretzschmaria deusta soft rot but ceramic-like fracture.<br>Risk assessment: Brown rot in structural members = HIGH PRIORITY		
14	YES	Fungi	Sporophore annual rings can help identify which group?	Ganoderma spp.	Kretzschmaria spp.	Meripilus spp.	Armillaria spp.	0	Ganoderma brackets often show distinct annual growth layers which can help approximate age of colonisation	Counting rings gives MINIMUM infection duration. Useful for understanding timeline of decay development	Perennial brackets: Ganoderma species produce brackets that persist year after year adding new pore layer annually.<br>Ring counting: Each ring = one growing season. Count from center outward. Gives minimum age of THAT bracket not necessarily age of infection.<br>Visible species: G. applanatum shows clearest rings G. australe also shows rings G. resinaceum shows rings.<br>Information gained: Approximate timeline of decay rate of progression whether decay is recent or long-established.<br>Caution: Bracket age not equal to infection age. Tree may have been colonised for years before first bracket appeared		
15	YES	Fungi	Which environmental condition most favours Meripilus giganteus?	Drought and exposed sites	Warm consistently moist soils	Highly alkaline substrates	Deep dry sands	1	Meripilus prefers moist shaded nutrient-rich soils often around beech on clay soils or in sheltered woodland	Common in parks gardens estate woodlands where conditions are favourable. Rarely found in exposed dry sites. Soil moisture is KEY factor	Preferred conditions: Consistent soil moisture clay soils ideal water-retentive loams shade or partial shade nutrient-rich soils sheltered from strong winds stable environments.<br>Host preference: Beech is PRIMARY host in UK - up to 80% of records. Also attacks oak horse chestnut lime sweet chestnut.<br>Site types: Parkland trees garden specimens woodland edges avenues churchyards historic estates.<br>Soil types: Clay and heavy loams most common. Rare on sandy soils. pH adaptable.<br>Fruiting season: Late summer to autumn. Brackets short-lived		
16	YES	Fungi	Bleeding lesions at the base of a beech are often associated with:	Ganoderma pfeifferi	Phytophthora cambivora	Armillaria ostoyae	Laetiporus sulphureus	1	Phytophthora species often cause bleeding basal cankers on beech and other broadleaves	They are oomycetes not true fungi but predispose trees to secondary decay pathogens. Bleeding cankers create entry points for Armillaria Ganoderma and other decay fungi	Organism type: Oomycete more closely related to algae than true fungi.<br>Species affecting beech: P. cambivora most common P. cactorum P. citricola complex.<br>Symptoms: Dark reddish-brown tarry or watery exudate seeping from bark at base or lower stem. Lesions often sunken bark may crack. Underlying cambium and phloem killed.<br>Other hosts: Horse chestnut sweet chestnut oak many ornamentals.<br>Consequence: Weakened bark/cambium allows SECONDARY colonisation by decay fungi.<br>Spread: Water-splash soil movement contaminated tools.<br>Management: No cure. Improve drainage monitor for secondary fungi		
17	YES	Fungi	Which fungus most commonly produces delamination separation of growth rings?	Sparassis crispa	Fistulina hepatica	Laetiporus sulphureus	Phaeolus schweinitzii	2	Laetiporus sulphureus can cause delamination and sheet-like separation of growth rings often in oak and other broadleaves	Ring separation is CHARACTERISTIC of Laetiporus. Wood splits along annual ring boundaries in sheets. Creates unique failure pattern - limbs or stems can peel apart in layers	Common name: Chicken of the Woods Sulphur Polypore.<br>Decay type: Brown rot causing cubical cracking AND characteristic delamination.<br>Delamination mechanism: Decay preferentially attacks junction between annual rings causing rings to separate in sheets.<br>Appearance: Bright yellow-orange brackets overlapping shelves soft when fresh no stem pore surface yellow.<br>Hosts: Oak primary sweet chestnut yew cherry willow.<br>Location: Often at mid-stem height or on scaffold branches occasionally at base.<br>Failure mode: Branch failure where delamination has occurred. Brittle fracture typical of brown rot		
18	YES	Fungi	A tree with extensive heartwood decay but intact sapwood is MOST likely to fail through:	Windthrow at roots	Compression/tension bending failure	Crown dieback only	Basal heave without uprooting	1	Heartwood decay reduces the stem's bending resistance making it more vulnerable to bending failure rather than uprooting	The outer shell carries most bending load. If heartwood is lost but sapwood intact the tree can remain stable OR fail by stem snap depending on shell adequacy. Roots usually still functional so windthrow less likely than stem failure	Heartwood function: Provides structural support especially compression strength dead tissue with no active transport contains extractives.<br>Sapwood function: Active water/nutrient transport living parenchyma cells more vulnerable to some fungi but has active defence.<br>When heartwood decays but sapwood intact: Section modulus reduced but outer fibres which carry most stress still present.<br>Failure mode: Bending failure at point of maximum stress.<br>Contrast: If ROOT decay present windthrow more likely. If STEM decay only bending failure more likely.<br>Assessment: Shell thickness critical		
19	YES	Fungi	Bracket fungi appearing high in the canopy usually indicate:	Root failure	Upper stem or scaffold branch decay	Early infection only	Nutrient deficiency	1	High-level sporophores signal decay within upper stems or scaffold limbs often long-developed by the time fruiting bodies appear	Branch failure risk may be significant. Decay at height is particularly concerning if branches overhang targets. May require aerial inspection or climbing assessment	Implication: Decay established at that height - affects branch or upper stem at that location. Fruiting body indicates advanced colonisation.<br>Common species found high: Ganoderma spp. Inonotus hispidus Laetiporus sulphureus.<br>Entry points at height: Branch stubs from poor pruning storm damage fork/union failures lightning strikes.<br>Assessment challenges: Ground-level inspection inadequate - may need binoculars aerial platform climbing arborist drone survey.<br>Risk consideration: Drop zone BELOW bracket is critical.<br>Branch failure modes: Entire branch failure snap at decay location progressive failure		
20	YES	Fungi	Which decay type is MOST associated with strong compartmentalisation by the host tree?	White rot	Soft rot	Brown rot	Sapstain fungi	1	Soft rot is slow and often strongly compartmentalised - CODIT barriers can effectively limit its progression	Compared to aggressive white rots which breach CODIT walls or brown rots which progress despite barriers soft rot advances slowly enough for trees to build effective defences	CODIT system: Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees - Shigo's 4-wall model.<br>Soft rot characteristics: Slower progression than white/brown rot cavity formation within cell walls allows time for effective barrier formation.<br>Success factors: Tree species oak better than beech tree vigour injury extent environmental conditions.<br>Visual pattern: Wedge-shaped decay column in cross-section when successful - sharp boundaries between sound and decayed wood		
21	YES	Fungi	A hollow stem with thick intact walls can still be structurally stable because:	Heartwood is the strongest part	Outer stem fibres carry most load	Hollows generate reaction wood	Decay increases elasticity	1	Most bending strength exists in the outer stem walls - hollow trees can remain strong if wall thickness is adequate	Engineering principle: A tube is stronger than a solid rod of equal mass. Many veteran trees remain safe for centuries despite hollowness. Wall thickness ratio t/R is critical - generally need greater than 0.3 for safety	Stress distribution: Bending stress highest at outer surface decreases toward centre. Removing centre has less impact than expected.<br>Critical factors: Wall thickness ratio t/R greater than 0.3 generally adequate wall continuity no large openings uniform thickness no stress concentrations/cracks.<br>Assessment tools: Tomography resistograph increment borer sounding.<br>Veteran tree note: Ancient oaks pollarded willows beech commonly hollow - can remain safe for centuries with adequate walls		
22	YES	Fungi	Which symptom usually indicates ADVANCED decay rather than early infection?	Localised bark death	Sporophore formation	Leaf chlorosis	Reduced annual increment	1	Most sporophores form AFTER significant decay has developed internally - the fruiting body is tip of the iceberg	Internal decay typically present for 5-15+ years before first fruiting. Finding a bracket means decay is established and advanced. Never wait for sporophores to assess - they're a late-stage indicator	Timeline: Most structural decay fungi colonise and spread extensively BEFORE producing fruiting bodies. Requires established mycelial network accumulated resources sexual maturity environmental triggers.<br>Species variation: Some fruit relatively quickly most structural fungi take years.<br>Critical point: Presence of sporophore equals advanced decay. Absence of sporophore does NOT equal absence of decay.<br>Use invasive testing to detect early.<br>Annual vs perennial: Both types indicate established colonisation		
23	YES	Fungi	Which feature increases reliability of assessing fungal risk?	Judging by sporophore colour alone	Understanding decay type and location	Counting mushrooms at the base	Measuring bark thickness	1	Risk depends on decay type extent and position - sporophore appearance alone is not reliable	Same fungus in roots vs branch equals very different risk. Location is THE strongest predictor: roots equals windthrow butt equals basal snap stem equals stem failure branch equals limb drop. Combine with decay type for full picture	Key factors hierarchy: 1. Location: Roots windthrow butt basal snap stem stem failure scaffold branch limb drop. 2. Decay type: Brown rot brittle sudden white rot progressive soft rot slow. 3. Extent: Percentage of cross-section affected residual wall thickness distribution. 4. Species: Some more aggressive than others. 5. Host vigor: Stressed trees less able to compartmentalise.<br>Assessment tools matched to situation: Visual probing sounding resistograph tomography pulling tests		
24	YES	Fungi	Trees infected with root-decay fungi typically show:	Uniform crown thinning	Asymmetric sway or instability under load	Stem bleeding at mid-height	Immediate foliage discoloration	1	Root decay often leads to instability especially under wind loading before obvious foliar symptoms appear	Subtle instability signs appear BEFORE crown decline: recent lean development soil cracks radiating from base asymmetric sway in wind root plate rocking sensation when pushed. These are early warnings - act on them	Instability indicators priority order: 1. Recent lean change 2. Soil cracks radiating from base 3. Lifted turf/soil on one side 4. Asymmetric sway in wind 5. Rocking sensation when tree pushed 6. Exposed roots on one side 7. Crown asymmetry developing.<br>Assessment protocol: Document lean probe root plate with steel rod excavate small test pits if necessary consider pulling test on high-value/high-risk trees.<br>High-risk fungi: Meripilus Ganoderma Armillaria Kretzschmaria		
25	YES	Fungi	Which factor MOST influences the likelihood of failure in fungal-decayed wood?	Decay fungus species only	Location of decay within the tree structure	Colour of the sporophore	Soil pH below 6	1	Decay location is the strongest predictor of failure behaviour	Same amount of decay has VASTLY different implications depending on where it occurs. Root decay equals windthrow. Butt decay equals basal snap. Mid-stem equals stem failure. Branch equals limb drop. Location drives risk assessment and management	Location-specific failure analysis: Root/Root Plate Decay - Failure mode: Windthrow. Warning signs: Soil cracks lean changes asymmetric sway. Assessment: Probe root plate excavation pulling tests.<br>Butt Decay lower 1-2m - Failure mode: Basal snap near ground level. Assessment: Sounding resistograph tomography of lower stem.<br>Stem Decay mid-height - Failure mode: Stem snap at decay location. Assessment: Shell thickness critical measure residual walls.<br>Scaffold Branch Decay - Failure mode: Branch failure/drop. Assessment: Aerial inspection assess drop zone targets.<br>Risk priority: Root/butt decay whole tree hazard		
26	YES	Assessment	Which tool measures drilling resistance to evaluate decay extent?	Tomograph	Resistograph	Dendrometer	Hypsometer	1	A resistograph measures drilling resistance as a needle penetrates wood creating a resistance profile that reveals decay cavities and sound wood	The drill encounters different resistance in sound wood high resistance vs decayed wood low resistance vs air gaps zero resistance. Output is a graph showing internal structure without destructive sampling	Principle: Fine needle 1.5-3mm drills into tree. Motor power required to advance drill at constant speed is measured and plotted. High resistance equals sound wood low equals decay zero equals cavity.<br>Output: Graph showing internal structure along drill path. Can detect cavities decay zones sound wood shells growth ring patterns.<br>Advantages: Minimal damage small hole quantifiable results can drill to 40cm+ depth repeatable relatively quick.<br>Limitations: Only samples one line expensive requires interpretation won't detect all decay types equally		
27	YES	Assessment	What does a tomograph primarily detect in tree assessment?	Root depth and spread	Internal decay extent and location	Soil compaction levels	Leaf chlorophyll content	1	Tomography detects internal decay by measuring sound wave velocity through wood - decayed wood transmits sound slower than healthy wood	Creates a 2D slice image showing internal structure at that height. Can map decay extent cavity size residual wall thickness and asymmetry. Non-invasive and provides visual output	Principle: Sensors placed around trunk at same height typically 8-12 sensors. Each sensor sends sound pulse; others measure arrival time. Sound travels faster through sound wood 4000+ m/s than decayed wood 1000-2000 m/s or cavities 300 m/s air.<br>Output: Color-coded 2D cross-section image: Green/blue sound wood yellow/orange weakened wood red/brown severe decay black cavity.<br>Advantages: Non-invasive visual output can test multiple heights repeatable works on any tree size.<br>Limitations: Expensive requires training only shows slices affected by moisture content results need expert interpretation		
28	YES	Assessment	Which assessment method applies controlled load to estimate root plate stability?	Chlorophyll fluorescence	Static pulling test	Dendrometry	Spectral analysis	1	Static pulling tests apply controlled load while measuring tree deflection and root plate movement to assess anchorage stability	Mimics wind loading in controlled way. Monitors how much tree/root plate moves under known load. Detects early instability before visible failure. Particularly useful for trees with suspected root decay	Principle: Controlled force applied to trunk using winch/weights while measuring stem deflection inclinometers at multiple heights root plate tilting inclinometers at base soil movement around base.<br>Procedure: Baseline readings taken no load gradual load increase measure response at each increment unload check for permanent deformation.<br>Key measurements: Load vs deflection curve root plate tilt angle permanent set after unloading comparative movement base vs crown.<br>Applications: Trees with suspected root decay veteran trees after root damage high-value/high-consequence trees.<br>Advantages: Directly tests actual stability quantify safety margins repeatable provides evidence		
29	YES	Assessment	An increment borer is primarily used to:	Measure tree height	Extract wood core samples for analysis	Test soil pH	Measure wind speed in canopy	1	An increment borer extracts a cylindrical core sample from trunk allowing examination of growth rings wood condition and decay without felling the tree	Can measure residual wall thickness in hollow trees sample for decay presence analyze growth rates date trees detect historic stress events. Minimally invasive	Tool description: Hollow metal tube with cutting thread. Screwed into tree trunk extracts cylindrical core typically 4-5mm diameter up to 40cm+ length.<br>Applications: 1. Measuring shell thickness in hollow trees 2. Detecting presence/extent of decay 3. Growth rate analysis 4. Tree dating 5. Historic stress detection 6. Species confirmation.<br>Technique: Select location without major defects bore perpendicular to trunk advance slowly extract core carefully examine immediately seal hole.<br>Advantages: Minimal damage direct examination quantifiable measurements inexpensive quick.<br>Limitations: Small sample size core can break needs skill creates potential entry point		
30	YES	Assessment	Sounding a tree with a mallet primarily detects:	Root depth	Presence of cavities or advanced decay	Soil moisture content	Crown density	1	Sounding produces different acoustic responses from sound wood solid thud versus decayed/hollow wood dull or hollow sound allowing cavity detection	Simple quick non-technical method anyone can do. Effective for initial screening. Useful but can't quantify extent	Principle: Sound waves travel differently through sound wood vs decayed/hollow wood. Ear detects difference in acoustic response when surface struck.<br>Technique: Use rubber/wooden mallet strike systematically at 20-30cm intervals around trunk at multiple heights listen carefully compare responses mark suspicious zones.<br>Sound interpretation: Sound wood clear solid thunk short duration high pitch. Decayed wood dull soft thud dampened sound lower pitch. Hollow/cavity resonant boom or ringing longer duration echo quality. Thin shell high-pitched hollow sound vibration felt.<br>Advantages: No equipment quick screening no damage anyone can learn good for initial assessment.<br>Limitations: Subjective cannot quantify can miss deep internal decay affected by bark thickness		
31	YES	Biomech	When assessing a leaning tree the ABSENCE of adaptive growth on the compression side most likely indicates:	Recent movement or progressive failure	Healthy established lean	Superior structural stability	Normal seasonal variation	0	Trees normally develop compensatory growth buttressing reaction wood on the compression side of established leans. Absence suggests recent/ongoing movement	If lean is long-established expect visible thickening on compression side. Lack of adaptation equals lean is recent OR tree is too stressed to respond OR failure is progressive. All scenarios require urgent assessment	Normal response to lean: Compression wood conifers or tension wood broadleaves forms over years visible as eccentric growth rings stem thickening on loaded side buttress development at base.<br>Timeline: Adaptive growth takes 3-5+ years to become visible. Recent leans months won't show adaptation.<br>Absence indicates: 1 Lean developed recently 2 Tree too stressed/declining to respond 3 Progressive failure ongoing 4 Root plate already compromised.<br>Assessment priorities: Compare to historic photos check for soil cracks/root plate movement investigate cause probe root plate consider pulling test assume high risk until proven otherwise		
32	YES	Biomech	In assessing fork strength a diameter ratio changing from 2:1 to 1.5:1 over several years suggests:	Improving structural integrity	Subordinate stem gaining dominance - monitor closely	Normal growth pattern	Immediate failure risk	1	Decreasing diameter ratio approaching 1:1 indicates subordinate stem is catching up - union may be weakening as stems compete	Optimal ratios are 2:1 or greater. As ratio decreases toward 1:1 union becomes weaker. This trend suggests developing co-dominance - higher failure risk. Monitor for included bark development consider selective reduction	Optimal hierarchy: Dominant stem should maintain 2:1 or greater diameter advantage over subordinate. This ensures proper load distribution and reduces included bark risk.<br>Why ratio decrease is concerning: Subordinate stem competing for apical dominance more similar diameters equals more similar bending stiffness equals higher stress concentration at union increased likelihood of included bark formation poor load distribution.<br>Management implications: Trending toward 1:1 equals intervene before it reaches parity. Options: subordinate reduction crown rebalancing consider removal of one stem.<br>Monitoring protocol: Measure both stem diameters annually calculate ratio document with photos track included bark		
33	YES	Biomech	A tree showing long-term wind deformation flagging but no recent damage represents:	Imminent failure risk requiring immediate action	Adapted stable condition - monitor normally	Declining health requiring intervention	Recent storm impact	1	Wind-adapted trees with flagging/asymmetric form are generally stable - the form represents successful adaptation to loading history	Flagging equals chronic wind exposure adaptation not acute failure. Tree has remodelled structure over years to accommodate prevailing winds. If no recent damage/movement treat as stable. Risk increases only if loading changes	Chronic adaptation signs: Flagging crown deflected in prevailing wind direction asymmetric crown development eccentric stem growth buttressing on windward side krummholz effect in extreme exposure.<br>These indicate SUCCESSFUL adaptation: Tree has grown under constant loading structure optimized for that environment stress wood integrated throughout root system developed asymmetrically.<br>Contrast - acute damage: Fresh broken branches recent lean new cracks root plate movement sudden asymmetry.<br>When wind-adapted trees become risky: 1 Loading changes shelter removed 2 Crown suddenly grows 3 Root decay develops 4 Age-related decline 5 Drought stress		
34	YES	Biomech	Multiple cavity openings on the same side of a stem are mechanically MORE concerning than a single large central cavity because:	They indicate more advanced age	Openings create stress concentration points in the shell	Multiple fungi are present	Surface area of decay is greater	1	Cavity openings act as stress concentrators - multiple openings on one side create multiple weak points where cracks can initiate	Single central cavity with intact shell equals load distributed around uniform tube. Multiple openings equals discontinuous shell with stress concentration at each opening edge. Cracks typically initiate at opening corners under bending load	Engineering principle: Any discontinuity in a loaded structure concentrates stress. In hollow trees openings disrupt shell continuity creating stress hot spots at opening edges especially corners.<br>Why multiple openings are worse: Each opening equals potential crack initiation point openings aligned vertically on same side equals shell effectively interrupted load cannot redistribute smoothly stress between openings is elevated crack from one opening can propagate to next.<br>Worst-case scenario: Multiple openings stacked vertically on TENSION side of dominant bending direction.<br>Assessment: Map opening locations measure dimensions calculate remaining shell continuity check for crack initiation tomography shows if openings connected internally		
35	YES	Soil	Soil bulk density exceeding 1.6 g/cm³ in the root zone primarily limits tree growth by:	Reducing nutrient concentration	Restricting root penetration and oxygen availability	Increasing soil pH	Lowering water holding capacity	1	High bulk density physically restricts root penetration and reduces pore space limiting oxygen diffusion to roots	Compacted soil has reduced macro-pore space. Roots cannot penetrate dense soil and remaining pores are water-filled limiting oxygen. Result: shallow root system poor anchorage drought stress reduced vigor	"Bulk density thresholds: Less than 1.4 g/cm³ good for root growth. 1.4-1.6 restricted growth. Greater than 1.6 severe restriction (species/soil texture dependent).<br>Mechanical restriction: Roots cannot physically push through dense soil. Penetrometer resistance greater than 2-3 MPa equals root barrier. Roots deflected or stopped.<br>Oxygen limitation: Compaction reduces macro-pores. Remaining pores fill with water. Oxygen cannot diffuse to roots. Anaerobic conditions develop. Root respiration impossible.<br>Consequences: Shallow restricted root systems. Poor anchorage - windthrow risk. Limited water access during drought. Nutrient uptake impaired. Overall vigor reduced. Tree decline.<br>Urban context: Construction traffic, material storage, vehicle parking all cause compaction. Root zones unprotected. Chronic problem in urban landscapes.<br>Assessment: Penetrometer testing (resistance measurement). Bulk density sampling. Visual inspection (surface crusting, poor drainage, puddling). Root excavation reveals shallow plate-like systems.<br>Species sensitivity: Beech very sensitive. Oak moderately sensitive. London plane relatively tolerant but still affected. Willows/poplars tolerate wet but not compacted conditions.<br>Prevention: Exclude traffic from root zones. Barriers, fencing, protective mulch. Prevention vastly better than remediation.<br>Remediation: Radial trenching, air-spading, vertical mulching, soil replacement. Results variable. Difficult and expensive. Prevention preferred."		
36	YES	Assessment	Visual Tree Assessment (VTA) primarily relies on:	Laboratory wood samples	External symptoms indicating internal problems	Destructive testing only	Chemical analysis of sap	1	VTA interprets visible symptoms as indicators of internal structural issues based on tree biomechanics and pathology	Trees grow optimized structures - visible anomalies signal internal problems. Understanding symptom-cause relationships allows non-destructive assessment of structural integrity	VTA methodology developed by Mattheck and Breloer. Core principle: Trees optimize for mechanical loads - visible defects indicate where optimization failed or compensation occurred.<br>Key observations: Growth patterns (reaction wood buttressing eccentric growth) bark condition (cracks wounds necrosis) fungal signs (sporophores mycelium exudates) mechanical symptoms (leans cracks cavities).<br>Interpretation requires understanding: tree biomechanics decay processes adaptive growth responses species-specific patterns.<br>Limitations: Cannot quantify internal decay extent - use with invasive tools for complete assessment.<br>Sequence: Visual first then targeted invasive testing where needed.		
37	YES	Assessment	A resistograph trace showing a sharp drop to zero resistance midway through drilling most likely indicates:	Dense reaction wood	A large internal cavity	The transition to heartwood	Normal growth ring variation	1	Zero resistance means the drill encountered an air gap - indicating a cavity or hollow zone	Healthy wood and even decayed wood provide some resistance. Zero equals void space. Sharp drops distinguish cavities from gradual decay transitions	Resistograph output interpretation: High consistent resistance (150-300% scale) = sound wood. Gradual decline = progressive decay. Sharp drop to 0-10% = cavity/void. Resistance fluctuations = growth rings (normal). Very high spikes = knots/wound tissue.<br>Cavity characteristics: Immediate drop vertical line on graph zero/near-zero flat section immediate return to resistance when exiting cavity.<br>Other features: Heartwood transition = gradual decline not sharp drop. Decay zones = reduced but not zero resistance irregular pattern. Multiple cavities = multiple drop/rise sequences.<br>Critical assessment: Note depth of cavity wall thickness remaining symmetry check multiple radii.		
38	YES	Risk	In quantified tree risk assessment the term 'likelihood of failure' combines:	Only the presence of defects	Load and resistance factors together	Soil type and tree age	Target value alone	1	Likelihood considers both the mechanical load the tree will experience AND its resistance/capacity to withstand that load	High load + low resistance = high likelihood. Low load + high resistance = low likelihood. Both factors must be assessed together for accurate risk evaluation	QTRA and similar methods assess: LOAD factors - wind exposure (site shelter canopy sail area) snow/ice loading (climate location crown form) typical weather patterns extreme event frequency.<br>RESISTANCE factors - structural defects (decay extent cavity size crack severity) biomechanical efficiency (form taper buttressing adaptive growth) root anchorage (root plate integrity soil conditions decay presence) overall tree condition (vigor health compartmentalization).<br>Calculation: Likelihood of FAILURE equals probability that LOAD exceeds RESISTANCE.<br>Why both matter: Sound tree in extreme exposure = higher risk than defective tree in sheltered location. Assessment must consider site-specific loading conditions.		
39	YES	Risk	Which factor typically represents the HIGHEST consequence in tree risk assessment?	Damage to the tree itself	Impact on nearby property or people	Cost of tree removal	Aesthetic loss to landscape	1	Consequence focuses on potential harm to people and property - human safety and high-value targets create highest consequence ratings	Risk = Likelihood × Consequence. Highest consequence is serious injury/death or major property damage. This drives management priorities	Consequence categories (ISA/TRAQ framework): PEOPLE - Death or serious injury highest. Minor injury moderate. No injury low.<br>PROPERTY - Structural damage to buildings/vehicles high. Damage to landscape features moderate. Cosmetic damage only low.<br>Target assessment: Occupancy (constant vs occasional) target value (high vs low) size of impact zone.<br>Examples EXTREME consequence: Tree over occupied building playground main road. SIGNIFICANT: Over parking lot utility lines secondary structures. MODERATE: Over lawn equipment shed rarely-used path. LOW: Remote location no targets.<br>Site factors affecting consequence: Traffic patterns pedestrian use time-of-day occupancy seasonal variation event schedules.		
40	YES	Risk	A tree with high likelihood of failure but very low consequence is typically managed by:	Immediate removal as highest priority	Monitoring with lower priority intervention	Extensive cabling and bracing	Legal action against owner	1	Risk management prioritizes based on overall risk (likelihood × consequence) - high likelihood but low consequence = lower priority than high-risk situations	Resources focus on HIGH risk (high likelihood AND high consequence). Low consequence situations allow monitoring-based approach even with defects present	Risk matrix approach: EXTREME risk (high likelihood + high consequence) = immediate action required remove or drastically mitigate. HIGH risk = prompt action within defined timeframe. MODERATE risk = planned intervention monitor closely. LOW risk (including high likelihood + low consequence) = routine monitoring manage when practical.<br>Example scenarios: HIGH likelihood + LOW consequence = Large decay cavity in tree over unused field - monitor document reassess periodically but not urgent. LOW likelihood + HIGH consequence = Sound tree with minor defect over playground - higher priority due to consequence.<br>Management options for low-risk scenarios: Extended inspection intervals photographic monitoring accept failure as tolerable risk defer work to coordinate with other site operations.		
41	YES	Assessment	The primary purpose of a tree pulling test is to:	Measure tree height accurately	Assess root plate stability under load	Determine exact failure load	Test soil bearing capacity	1	Pulling tests apply controlled load while measuring root plate and stem movement to evaluate anchorage and detect early instability	Non-destructive method that simulates wind loading. Detects root plate compromise before visible failure signs appear	Methodology: Winch or weights apply incremental force to trunk (typically at 2/3 height). Measurements taken: stem deflection at multiple heights (inclinometers) root plate tilt angle at base soil surface movement around root collar applied load magnitude. Baseline reading with no load then gradual increase.<br>Procedure: Load applied in steps hold at each increment record measurements check for non-linear responses unload completely measure permanent set (should return to baseline).<br>Interpretation: LINEAR response = stable system elastic deformation. NON-LINEAR response = yielding soil movement root damage occurring. PERMANENT deformation after unload = damage occurred instability present.<br>Thresholds: Tilt angle greater than 0.25° concerning. Load vs deflection curve changing slope indicates problems.<br>Applications: Veteran trees with suspected root decay trees after root damage pre-emptive assessment of high-value specimens.		
42	YES	Assessment	Tomography is MOST useful for:	Determining species identification	Visualizing internal decay extent and distribution	Measuring annual growth rates	Assessing leaf chlorophyll content	1	Tomography creates 2D cross-sectional images showing internal wood condition - reveals decay location extent and remaining sound wood	Non-invasive method that maps internal structure. Critical for quantifying residual wall thickness in hollow trees and detecting hidden decay	Technology: Sonic or electrical resistance tomography. SONIC: Sensors around trunk send sound pulses through wood. Sound velocity varies: 4000-5000 m/s through sound wood 1000-2000 m/s through decay 300-400 m/s through air (cavities). Computer generates color-coded cross-section.<br>Output interpretation: BLUE/GREEN = sound wood high velocity. YELLOW/ORANGE = compromised wood moderate decay. RED/BROWN = severe decay. BLACK = cavity or air.<br>Critical information gained: Residual wall thickness measure t/R ratio. Decay distribution symmetric vs asymmetric. Cavity size and location. Remaining load-bearing capacity.<br>Limitations: Shows slice at ONE height only - test multiple heights for complete picture. Affected by moisture content grain direction species characteristics. Best used WITH visual assessment and other tools.<br>Cost: Expensive equipment requires trained operator but provides quantifiable data for risk assessment and expert reports.		
43	YES	Biomech	Reaction wood in broadleaves (tension wood) forms on the:	Compression side of bends	Tension side of bends	Neutral axis only	Random locations throughout stem	1	Broadleaf trees form tension wood on the upper/tension side of leaning stems and branches - it pulls the stem upward	Opposite to conifers which form compression wood. Tension wood has higher cellulose content and pulls branches up. Understanding location helps interpret adaptive growth patterns	Tension wood characteristics: Location - upper side of leaning stems and branches (tension zone during bending). Microscopic - gelatinous G-layer in fibers unlignified inner wall high cellulose content. Appearance - often darker than normal wood may show silvery sheen when fresh lustrous surface. Mechanical function - contracts along grain pulls stem/branch upward counteracts gravitational loading.<br>Why upper side: Bending mechanics put upper surface in tension. Tree reinforces tension zone to pull itself back toward vertical. Growth rings show eccentric pattern - wider on upper side.<br>Common situations: Leaning trees recovering from disturbance horizontal branches (all have tension wood on top) trees on slopes compensating for lean.<br>Contrast with compression wood: Conifers form compression wood on LOWER side which pushes. Broadleaves pull with tension wood on UPPER side. Both achieve similar result through different mechanisms.<br>Assessment implications: Presence indicates tree responding to loading adaptive growth is GOOD sign. Absence in leaning tree suggests recent movement or failing tree unable to respond.		
44	YES	Risk	The 'target' in tree risk assessment refers to:	The tree being assessed	People property or activities that could be harmed	The specific defect being evaluated	The inspection area boundary	1	Target is what could be struck or harmed if the tree or part fails - people buildings vehicles utilities infrastructure	Risk requires three elements: Tree with defect (hazard) + Environmental factors (likelihood) + Target (consequence). No target = no risk regardless of tree condition	Target types: HIGH-VALUE targets - Occupied buildings (homes schools hospitals) constantly-used areas (playgrounds parking lots sidewalks) major roads with heavy traffic occupied vehicles utilities (power lines gas mains).<br>MODERATE-VALUE - Secondary structures (sheds garages) equipment occasionally-used paths vehicles in driveways minor utilities.<br>LOW-VALUE - Turf areas storage yards remote sections gardens lawn furniture.<br>Target assessment factors: OCCUPANCY RATE - Constant (sidewalk parking) vs occasional (picnic area) vs rare (remote field). Time exposure affects likelihood of impact. VALUE - Replacement cost safety implications legal liability. SIZE/AREA - Larger targets easier to hit higher probability. MOBILITY - Stationary targets (buildings) vs mobile (pedestrians may see and avoid).<br>Assessment protocol: Map all potential targets within fall zone. Rate each target's value and occupancy. Calculate probability of impact if failure occurs. Highest risk = most likely failure × highest consequence target.<br>Management: Can reduce risk by moving targets (redirect traffic close areas) or removing tree.		
45	YES	Assessment	Crown condition assessment primarily evaluates:	Exact leaf count	Indicators of tree vitality and health	Aesthetic value only	Timber quality	1	Crown assessment looks at foliage density twig dieback branch structure and overall vigor as indicators of root function vascular health and stress levels	Crown is the tree's factory - poor crown condition signals problems elsewhere (roots vascular system pathogens). Important for evaluating overall tree condition and prognosis	Crown assessment parameters: DENSITY - Percentage of crown filled with foliage. Compare to species typical. Thin crown (less than 50%) concerning.<br>DIEBACK - Dead tips and branches. Recent vs old. Progression pattern. Percentage of crown affected.<br>COLOR - Appropriate for season and species. Chlorosis (yellowing) indicates stress. Early autumn color = problem.<br>SIZE/EXTENT - Appropriate for trunk diameter and species. Stunted crown = chronic stress.<br>TWIG GROWTH - Annual extension length. Short extensions = stress. Compare recent vs historical.<br>BRANCH STRUCTURE - Die-back pattern symmetry/asymmetry epicormic growth.<br>Common patterns: GENERAL DECLINE - Overall thinning progressive dieback affecting whole crown indicates root problems vascular disease chronic stress. SECTIONAL DECLINE - One side affected suggests root damage on that side vascular blockage localized pathogen. TIP DIEBACK - From periphery inward suggests environmental stress (drought salt) or root problems.<br>Assessment implications: Good crown with structural defect = tree has vigor to compensate may be manageable. Poor crown with structural defect = tree declining unable to compartmentalize higher risk priorities intervention. Crown assessment combined with trunk and root evaluation gives complete picture.		
46	YES	Risk	In the ISA risk assessment methodology 'imminent' failure means:	Will fail within 5 years	Failure expected within hours to days	Moderate likelihood over several years	Structural defect is present	1	Imminent failure classification means failure could occur at any time - often weather-dependent but timeframe is hours to days not months or years	Reserved for extreme situations requiring immediate action. Means failure is highly likely in very near term with next loading event	ISA likelihood categories: IMMINENT - Failure expected imminently (hours to days). Often weather-dependent but could occur any time. Examples: Large crack with active movement stem nearly severed tree rocking in light wind root plate lifting. Action: Immediate barriers closure removal if possible.<br>PROBABLE - Failure likely within 1 year under normal conditions. Defects are advanced and tree cannot resist typical loading. Examples: Extensive decay thin shell large cavity in high-stress zone advanced root decay. Action: Prioritize for mitigation or removal.<br>POSSIBLE - Failure could occur but not probable. Defects present but tree has some capacity. May require extraordinary load. Examples: Moderate decay adequate shell minor cracks compensatory growth present. Action: Monitor reduce loading if feasible plan intervention.<br>IMPROBABLE - Failure unlikely. Minor defects only or sound tree. Typical loads well within capacity. Examples: Small wounds minor decay good form and vigor. Action: Routine monitoring.<br>Critical distinction IMMINENT vs PROBABLE: IMMINENT = could fail TODAY or with next wind event. Requires immediate site control. PROBABLE = will likely fail THIS YEAR during typical weather. Requires prompt action but brief delay acceptable to plan properly.		
47	YES	Assessment	Which condition would LEAST affect the accuracy of a resistograph reading?	Recent rainfall	Extreme cold temperatures	Species with very hard wood	Time of day	3	Time of day doesn't significantly affect wood resistance - the other factors do impact drilling resistance and interpretation	Moisture content temperature and wood density all affect drilling resistance. Time of day has minimal effect on these properties in standing trees	Factors affecting resistograph accuracy: MOISTURE CONTENT - Wet wood drills easier than dry shows lower resistance. Can mask decay or make sound wood appear weaker than it is. Test when moisture content is typical/normal for conditions. Avoid testing immediately after heavy rain or irrigation.<br>TEMPERATURE - Extreme cold makes wood harder to drill increased resistance can mask decay. Frozen wood especially problematic - appears sound when it's not. Test during moderate temperatures if possible.<br>WOOD DENSITY/SPECIES - Very hard woods (oak hornbeam) show high baseline resistance throughout. Very soft woods (poplar willow) show lower resistance even when sound. Know species-typical patterns. Requires experience interpreting species-specific traces.<br>GRAIN ANGLE - Drilling perpendicular to grain gives accurate reading. Drilling parallel or oblique gives misleading results. Ensure perpendicular entry.<br>LOCATION - Reaction wood wound wood can show atypical high resistance. Test representative normal wood when possible.<br>Best practices: Test during growing season or dormant but not frozen. Multiple radii to check symmetry. Calibrate expectations for species. Compare to reference samples if uncertain. Document conditions during testing. Combine with other assessment methods.<br>Time of day: Minimal effect - tree moisture content doesn't fluctuate significantly hour-to-hour in standing trees.		
48	YES	Biomech	The 'neutral axis' in a bending stem is where:	Maximum stress occurs	Stress is zero - neither tension nor compression	The tree is most likely to fail	Decay is most dangerous	1	During bending the neutral axis experiences no stress - it's the transition zone between tension (outer) and compression (inner) sides	Understanding stress distribution helps evaluate where decay matters most. Decay at neutral axis has less impact than decay in high-stress zones	Beam bending mechanics: When stem bends under load one side stretches (TENSION) opposite side compresses (COMPRESSION). Between them is NEUTRAL AXIS - zero stress zone.<br>Location: Typically through geometric center of cross-section. Can shift if decay/cavity present or asymmetric loading.<br>Stress distribution: MAXIMUM stress at outer fibers (top and bottom of bending beam). ZERO stress at neutral axis. LINEAR gradient between.<br>Engineering implications: Outer wood carries most bending load - this is why hollow trees can remain strong if shell is adequate. Center contributes little to bending strength - removing center (decay/cavity) has less impact than expected. Failures initiate at high-stress zones not neutral axis.<br>Risk assessment applications: Decay location matters - Decay at periphery (high-stress zone) VERY concerning. Decay at center (near neutral axis) LESS concerning if shell adequate. Openings/wounds - On tension/compression side worse than on neutral axis sides. Multiple openings - Align vertically on high-stress side = highest risk.<br>Section modulus calculations: Account for stress distribution. Hollow cylinder has good bending strength despite missing center.		
49	YES	Risk	Which scenario represents the HIGHEST overall risk?	Sound tree over remote field	Decayed tree over unused storage area	Moderate defect over busy parking lot	Minor defect over main entrance	3	Risk combines likelihood AND consequence - minor defect over high-consequence target can equal higher total risk than major defect over low-consequence target	Risk assessment must weigh both axes. Very high consequence can elevate even low-likelihood scenarios to high priority	Risk matrix evaluation: EXTREME RISK - High likelihood + High consequence. Example: Advanced decay over occupied building. Action: Immediate.<br>HIGH RISK - Moderate/high likelihood + High consequence OR High likelihood + Moderate consequence. Examples: Moderate decay over parking lot OR Advanced decay over lawn. Action: Prompt.<br>MODERATE RISK - Lower likelihood + Moderate consequence OR Moderate likelihood + Low consequence.<br>ACCEPTABLE/LOW RISK - Low likelihood + Low consequence. Example: Sound tree over remote area.<br>Scenario analysis: SOUND tree over REMOTE field = LOW likelihood + LOW consequence = ACCEPTABLE RISK. No action needed. DECAYED tree over UNUSED storage = HIGH likelihood + LOW consequence = MODERATE RISK. Can monitor. MODERATE defect over BUSY PARKING = MODERATE likelihood + HIGH consequence = HIGH RISK. Prompt action needed. MINOR defect over MAIN ENTRANCE = LOW/MODERATE likelihood + VERY HIGH consequence (constant occupancy people) = HIGH RISK. Address proactively.<br>Why minor defect over entrance is highest: Consequence is VERY HIGH - people constantly present serious injury possible major liability. Even low likelihood becomes unacceptable when consequence extreme. Legal and moral duty of care requires action.<br>Management: May be more cost-effective to reduce consequence (relocate entrance redirect traffic) than remove tree if defect truly minor and you want to retain tree.		
50	YES	Assessment	Increment borer samples are MOST useful for:	Measuring exact decay boundaries	Determining residual wall thickness and presence of decay	Identifying all fungal species present	Creating complete internal map	1	Increment borers extract narrow core samples allowing measurement of sound wood shell thickness and detection of decay presence without felling tree	Minimally invasive targeted sampling. Can't map entire internal structure but excellent for measuring specific shell thickness or confirming suspected decay	Increment borer applications: SHELL THICKNESS MEASUREMENT - In hollow/suspected hollow trees bore from exterior to cavity measure sound shell thickness calculate t/R ratio determine if adequate for stability. Most important use for risk assessment.<br>DECAY DETECTION - Core shows presence of decay visual inspection color texture smell integrity. Can confirm suspected internal decay without tomography. Core characteristics: Decayed wood = discolored soft crumbly. Sound wood = normal color firm clean separation.<br>GROWTH RATE - Count rings measure ring width analyze growth patterns detect stress events (suppression release).<br>TREE DATING - Count rings to determine age useful for veteran trees historic specimens.<br>SPECIES CONFIRMATION - Wood structure can confirm species if foliage absent.<br>Technique: Select location without external defects knots. Bore perpendicular to stem. Advance slowly and steadily. Extract core intact if possible. Examine immediately - photograph measure document. Seal hole with wound sealant or leave open (no sealant may be better).<br>Core interpretation: HOLLOW trees - bore until resistance drops (cavity reached) measure distance equals shell thickness. SUSPECTED DECAY - bore through suspected zone look for discolored wood zones abrupt color changes. Compare to sound reference.<br>Limitations: ONLY samples one line - decay may exist elsewhere. Core can BREAK in cavity or decay zone giving false impression. SMALL sample size may miss pockets. CREATES potential entry point for pathogens.<br>Best practice: Multiple borings different radii and heights combine with tomography for complete picture.		
51	YES	Biomech	A tree with strong compensatory growth around a defect suggests:	The tree is actively failing	The tree is adapting to maintain strength	Decay is progressing rapidly	Immediate removal required	1	Compensatory growth (buttressing thickening reinforcement) shows the tree is actively responding to structural stress by adding wood where needed	Trees are dynamic self-optimizing structures. Compensatory growth indicates successful adaptation and ability to maintain stability despite defects	Compensatory growth patterns: RADIAL THICKENING - Stem diameter increases around defect area strengthening weak zone. Growth rings wider on loaded sides.<br>BUTTRESSING - Formation of ribs flanges or buttresses adjacent to defect transfers loads around weak area.<br>ADAPTIVE GROWTH RINGS - Eccentric growth putting more wood where stress is highest optimizing cross-section.<br>CALLUS FORMATION - Wound wood rolls forming around injuries attempting closure and reinforcement.<br>Biomechanical principle (Axiom of Uniform Stress): Trees add wood where stress is highest attempting to equalize stress distribution. Growth follows mechanical demand. Visible compensatory growth proves tree is RESPONDING to its structural situation.<br>Assessment implications: PRESENT compensatory growth = Tree has vigor and is actively managing its defect lower concern tree attempting stabilization. Defect likely long-standing and tree has adapted. May be monitorable. ABSENT compensatory growth on long-standing defect = Tree declining unable to respond OR defect developed too recently for response yet. Higher concern. Recent defect without compensation = Evaluate urgently may not be stable.<br>Examples: Buttress swelling around cavity opening shows tree reinforcing that area. Rib formation along crack line shows tree attempting to stabilize. Thickened stem below fork junction shows tree reinforcing weak union.<br>Management: Compensatory growth GOOD sign but doesn't eliminate risk. Still assess load capacity failure modes targets. Growth indicates tree trying but may not be sufficient - quantify adequacy.		
52	YES	Risk	The term 'target zone' in risk assessment refers to:	Area within the tree's root zone	Area where tree parts could land if they fail	The specific part of tree being assessed	The inspection boundary	1	Target zone is the area that could be impacted if the tree or part fails - defines which targets are at risk and helps determine consequence ratings	Also called fall zone impact zone or strike zone. Size depends on tree height defect location and failure mode anticipated	Target zone determination: WHOLE TREE FAILURE - Zone extends from base in all directions. Radius typically equals 1-1.5× tree height (trees rarely fall perfectly straight may pivot bounce roll).<br>STEM FAILURE - Zone extends from failure point downward/outward. Partial tree height.<br>BRANCH FAILURE - Zone underneath and around branch. Branch length determines extent.<br>FACTORS affecting zone size: Tree height (taller = larger zone). Canopy width (wider = larger lateral extent). Slope (downhill extent greater). Obstacles (adjacent trees may arrest fall). Wind direction (prevailing winds may bias failure direction).<br>Target zone mapping: Draw zone on site plan or aerial photo. Identify ALL targets within zone (buildings roads vehicles utilities people activity areas). Rate occupancy and value of each target. Determine highest-consequence target drives risk rating.<br>Risk scenarios: Tree failure with NO targets in zone = NO RISK regardless of likelihood. Tree with targets CONSTANTLY in zone = HIGH CONSEQUENCE even low likelihood creates risk. Seasonal targets - Pool area (summer) parking (winter) affect seasonal risk.<br>Management strategies: REMOVE tree if high-likelihood and high-consequence targets in zone. MODIFY zone - Barriers fencing redirect traffic close areas seasonally. REDUCE likelihood - Pruning cabling bracing reduce load. ACCEPTANCE - If consequences low and likelihood moderate may accept risk.<br>Target zone essential for: Prioritizing work - Focus on trees with highest-consequence targets in zone. Communication - Show clients/public where risk exists. Legal defensibility - Demonstrate you identified and evaluated relevant hazards.		
53	YES	Assessment	Aerial inspection using climbing arborists or aerial lifts is most necessary when:	Ground inspection is sufficient for all trees	Defects suspected at height or visual access is limited	Trees are too tall to assess	Only for timber quality evaluation	1	Aerial inspection allows close examination of upper stem scaffold branches unions and defects that cannot be seen adequately from ground	Ground-level inspection has limits - canopy defects hidden by foliage structural issues visible only up close. Aerial access provides complete assessment	When aerial inspection indicated: DEFECTS AT HEIGHT - Sporophores visible in canopy suggest decay present. Cracks visible from ground need close examination. Branch unions with included bark need inspection. Storm damage in crown requires assessment.<br>HIGH-VALUE/HIGH-RISK trees - Trees over critical targets warrant thorough assessment. Veteran/historic specimens deserve detailed evaluation. Trees with high removal cost justify inspection investment.<br>OBSCURED VIEW - Dense foliage blocks ground view of upper stem/branches. Adjacent trees obscure sight lines. Height/distance make ground assessment inadequate.<br>POST-STORM assessment - Evaluate hanging branches torn limbs crack extent. Determine retention vs removal.<br>Methods: CLIMBING ARBORIST - Access all parts of crown. Close tactile inspection (probe sound test unions). Most thorough but slowest. AERIAL LIFT - Faster than climbing better for large trees open sites. Limited by access reach obstacles. DRONE - Good for visual survey photographic documentation. Cannot probe or sound. Best for initial screening.<br>Inspection scope from aerial position: PROBE scaffold branch junctions for decay. SOUND hollow stems check shell thickness. EXAMINE crack extent direction propagation. ASSESS union strength included bark extent. EVALUATE adaptive growth compensatory patterns. PHOTOGRAPH document findings for report.<br>Documentation: Photos from aerial position showing defects. Measurements of crack lengths shell thickness. Detailed notes on findings.<br>Report integration: Combines ground assessment with aerial findings. Provides complete picture of structural condition. Justifies management recommendations.<br>Cost-benefit: Expensive but necessary for complete assessment of complex or high-value trees. May reveal hidden issues that change management decisions. Legal protection demonstrates thorough evaluation.		
54	YES	Biomech	Trees growing on slopes typically develop:	Symmetrical root systems	Asymmetric root plates with more development on downhill side	No buttressing patterns	Identical growth to flat-ground trees	1	Slope-grown trees develop asymmetric root systems with enhanced buttressing and root development on the downhill tension side to resist overturning	Gravity creates constant loading - tree must resist both bending moment and overturning forces. Root architecture reflects mechanical demands of sloped terrain	Biomechanics of trees on slopes: GRAVITATIONAL LOADING - Constant downslope force component. Tree stem under bending stress. Root plate under overturning moment.<br>STABILIZATION strategy - DOWNHILL side (tension) develops extensive root plate shallow spreading roots buttress roots resists uplift. UPHILL side (compression) develops fewer structural roots compression roots resists downslope sliding.<br>Root architecture patterns: DOWNHILL - Larger buttresses more pronounced ribs longer lateral roots heart-root system resistance to tension/uplift. UPHILL - Smaller buttresses deeper sinker roots compression resistance anchors against sliding.<br>Stem characteristics: Often slight lean downslope initially then curves upward. Reaction wood on downslope side (tension wood in broadleaves). Eccentric growth rings - wider on tension side.<br>Risk implications: UPHILL root zone damage VERY concerning - removes compression anchor tree can slide/topple downhill. DOWNHILL root zone damage less critical but still important.<br>Excavation concerns: Cut slope above tree = removes uphill support. Fill downslope = buries roots affects downhill anchorage.<br>Slope failure considerations: Trees may fail during heavy rain when soil saturates loses shear strength. Whole slope movement can take trees with it.<br>Assessment: Excavate to examine root architecture both sides. Check for soil movement signs cracks. Consider slope angle steeper = higher loads. Evaluate soil type cohesion shear strength.<br>Management: Avoid disturbing uphill root zone. Protect both sides but prioritize uphill. Consider slope stabilization if movement evident.<br>Recognize natural adaptation - asymmetry is NORMAL and GOOD on slopes not a defect.		
55	YES	Assessment	The purpose of a decay detection drill (smaller than resistograph) is to:	Create drainage holes	Quickly probe multiple locations for presence of decay	Measure exact cavity size	Replace visual assessment	1	Small decay detection drills (like Shigometer or IML Resi) allow rapid probing of multiple points to detect presence and approximate extent of decay	Less sophisticated than resistograph but faster and cheaper. Useful for initial screening before investing in detailed testing. Helps target resistograph or tomography locations	Decay detection drill characteristics: SIMPLE DESIGN - Small diameter bit (2-4mm) hand-powered or electric. Drilling resistance felt by operator.<br>SPEED - Quick to use multiple probes possible in minutes.<br>COST - Inexpensive compared to resistograph/tomography.<br>Technique: Drill perpendicular into suspected decay zone. Feel resistance as you advance. Sound wood = consistent firm resistance. Decayed wood = reduced resistance soft crumbly feel. Cavity = sudden loss of resistance drill advances freely. Note depth where resistance changes.<br>Applications: SCREENING survey - Probe multiple trees quickly identify which need detailed assessment. TARGETING - Determine decay extent before using expensive tools locate decay boundaries guide resistograph/tomography placement. CONFIRMATION - Verify suspected decay from visual symptoms or previous testing. PROGRESS monitoring - Re-probe to check if decay advancing over time.<br>Interpretation: Presence/absence detection only - not quantitative. Approximate depth - measure how far drill penetrated before decay found. Pattern - probe multiple locations to map extent.<br>Limitations: SUBJECTIVE - Operator feel not measured data. SMALL diameter - May miss small decay pockets. NO PERMANENT RECORD - Unlike resistograph no graph to review or share. CREATES HOLES - Many small wounds vs few resistograph holes.<br>Best practice: Use for initial survey and targeting. Follow up positive findings with resistograph or tomography for quantification. Document locations and findings. Multiple probes around circumference at suspected defect height.<br>Shigometer note: Early electronic version measured electrical resistance related to moisture/decay but interpretation challenging. Modern tools often simpler mechanical drills.		
56	YES	Risk	Residual Risk after implementing risk reduction measures is:	Always eliminated completely	The risk remaining after mitigation efforts	Higher than original risk	Irrelevant once work is done	1	Residual risk is what remains after you've taken action - no mitigation makes risk zero so some level always remains	Risk management aims to reduce risk to acceptable levels not eliminate it entirely. Understanding residual risk helps determine if additional measures needed	Risk mitigation example: ORIGINAL RISK - Large decayed tree over parking lot. High likelihood of limb failure × High consequence = EXTREME RISK.<br>MITIGATION - Crown reduction removes large limbs over target reduces weight and load.<br>RESIDUAL RISK - Tree still present still some decay but reduced loading reduced consequence (smaller parts could fall). Perhaps HIGH or MODERATE risk remaining.<br>Evaluation: Is RESIDUAL RISK ACCEPTABLE? If yes - retain tree with reduced risk. If no - Additional measures needed (more pruning removal target relocation barriers).<br>Common mitigation strategies and residual risk: PRUNING - Reduces load and consequence (smaller failures) but doesn't eliminate decay or improve root plate. RESIDUAL = Stem failure possible. CABLING - Reduces movement and likelihood of union failure but cable can fail and decay may progress. RESIDUAL = Hardware failure or progressive decay. REMOVAL OF DEFECTIVE PARTS - Eliminates specific hazard but rest of tree remains. RESIDUAL = Other parts may fail. TARGET MODIFICATION - Eliminates or reduces consequence but tree unchanged. RESIDUAL = Tree still defective but consequences minimal. REMOVAL - Eliminates tree hazard. RESIDUAL = Stump sprouts may develop work hazards during removal.<br>Acceptance criteria: EXTREME residual risk = unacceptable require additional action. HIGH residual risk = case-by-case tolerable if targets low-value or alternative infeasible. MODERATE/LOW residual risk = generally acceptable.<br>Documentation: State original risk mitigation performed residual risk assessment residual risk acceptability. Shows due diligence.<br>Re-assessment: Residual risk can INCREASE over time as conditions change - Decay progresses. Loading increases (crown grows). Targets change (new building). Monitor and reassess periodically.<br>Legal considerations: Demonstrates you took action and evaluated effectiveness. Defensible if incident occurs and residual risk was deemed acceptable.		
57	YES	Biomech	The structural advantage of taper (stem thicker at base than top) is:	Aesthetic appearance only	Optimizes stress distribution and resists bending/buckling	Allows easier climbing	Improves water transport	1	Taper maintains more uniform stress from base to top - material is distributed where bending moment is greatest (at base) preventing overstress and buckling	Trees optimize structure using minimal material. Taper is mechanically efficient design distributing wood where needed most	Taper biomechanics: BENDING MOMENT - Increases from top (zero) to base (maximum due to lever arm of crown mass and height).<br>OPTIMAL DESIGN - Diameter increases proportionally to resist increasing bending stress. Result = More uniform stress throughout height.<br>Why taper matters: PREVENTS BUCKLING - Slender parallel columns buckle. Taper adds basal stability. MATERIAL EFFICIENCY - Puts wood where loads highest. Saves resources at top where loads minimal. FAILURE RESISTANCE - If all parts equally stressed then no weak point. Without taper base overstressed top wasteful.<br>Assessment of taper: GOOD TAPER - Gradual increase from top to base smooth transition visually tree-form. POOR TAPER - Parallel stem (same diameter throughout) indicates weak design. Sudden changes - Abrupt narrowing may indicate stress point.<br>Loss of taper concerns: CANOPY REDUCTION - Reduces top loading but base unchanged may be over-designed OR base decay means taper loss is DANGEROUS. STEM GIRDLING - Constriction prevents diameter growth above loses taper becomes vulnerable. HISTORIC POLLARDING - Bolling (swollen base) with thin regrowth lacks taper.<br>Recognition of poor taper: Tree same width top to bottom. Stem looks like pole or column. Often in suppressed trees that grew up in competition then released. Urban trees over-pruned or topped historically.<br>Risk implications: Loss of taper = Increased buckling risk especially in wind. Vulnerable to stem snap at narrowest point. Combined with decay may be critical.<br>Natural optimization: Trees add more diameter where most needed following constant stress principle. Taper is visible evidence of successful optimization.		
58	YES	Risk	When multiple trees pose risk the priority for mitigation should be based on:	Age of trees oldest first	Height of trees tallest first	Overall risk rating highest risk first	Cost of work cheapest first	2	Prioritization must be risk-based - address highest risk (likelihood × consequence) situations first to maximize safety benefit and efficient resource use	Risk-based prioritization ensures limited resources go to greatest hazards. Age height or cost are not primary factors - risk level determines urgency	Priority framework: EXTREME RISK - Immediate action required within days. High likelihood + High consequence. Example: Broken branch hung over entrance. Action: Immediate barriers closure emergency work.<br>HIGH RISK - Prompt action within weeks to few months. Moderate/high likelihood + High consequence OR High likelihood + Moderate consequence. Action: Schedule soon don't delay beyond current season.<br>MODERATE RISK - Planned action within 1-2 years. Lower likelihood + Moderate consequence OR Moderate likelihood + Lower consequence. Action: Include in normal work cycle budget for upcoming season.<br>LOW RISK - Routine monitoring acceptable. Low likelihood + Low consequence. Action: Monitor during regular inspections manage when convenient.<br>Example priority scenario: Tree A - Sound tree over playground (low likelihood + extreme consequence) = HIGH RISK. Tree B - Advanced decay over storage (high likelihood + low consequence) = MODERATE RISK. Tree C - Broken limb over entrance (imminent + high consequence) = EXTREME RISK. Tree D - Minor defect in remote area (low + low) = LOW RISK. Correct priority: C (extreme) then A (high) then B (moderate) then D (low).<br>Why not age/height/cost: Old trees may be LOW risk if sound and targets minimal. Young trees may be HIGH risk if defective over critical targets. Tall trees remote location = low risk. Short trees over entrance = high risk. Expensive work on low-risk tree wastes resources. Cheap work on high-risk tree is great value.<br>Resource allocation: Limited budget = Address extreme and high risk first accept moderate/low. Unlimited budget = Still address by priority for efficiency and safety.<br>Documentation: Priority list with risk ratings justifies decisions. Shows systematic approach. Legal protection if incident occurs on lower-priority tree.<br>Re-prioritization: Conditions change - reassess periodically. Storm damage may elevate previously low-risk trees. Target changes (new building) may elevate tree risk.		
59	YES	Assessment	A fractometer test measures:	Soil pH levels	Wood strength by breaking a core sample	Tree height precisely	Root distribution	1	Fractometer measures bending strength of increment core samples by applying load until core fractures - indicates wood strength and decay extent	Quantifies wood mechanical properties. Healthy wood breaks at higher load than decayed wood. Provides objective strength data for assessment	Fractometer methodology: Extract increment core using increment borer. Place core in fractometer device (small hand-held unit). Apply gradually increasing bending force. Measure load at fracture.<br>Output: Force required to break core (Newtons or pounds). Compare to species-typical values.<br>Interpretation: HIGH fracture load (above species normal) = Sound wood good strength. MEDIUM fracture load (species typical) = Normal wood. LOW fracture load (well below typical) = Decayed or weakened wood compromised strength. VERY LOW (fraction of normal) = Advanced decay little residual strength.<br>Applications: DECAY EXTENT - Cores from decay zone test strength quantify severity. Compare sound vs suspicious wood. RESIDUAL STRENGTH - In trees with known decay determine if remaining shell adequate. Combine with shell thickness for section modulus calculations. COMPARATIVE - Test multiple radii or heights map strength distribution. PROGRESS MONITORING - Re-test over time to check decay progression.<br>Species considerations: Must compare to SPECIES-TYPICAL values - oak breaks at different load than willow. Reference databases exist or establish baseline from sound reference trees.<br>Advantages: QUANTITATIVE - Objective numeric data not subjective. EVIDENCE - Provides supporting data for reports and recommendations. SIMPLE - Easy to use in field with cores.<br>Limitations: SMALL SAMPLE - Only tests the core extracted may not represent whole. CORE QUALITY - Broken/damaged cores give false readings must be intact. MOISTURE DEPENDENT - Wet wood tests weaker dry harder must note conditions. NOT UNIVERSAL - Doesn't replace assessment just adds quantitative component.<br>Best practice: Combine with visual assessment tomography resistograph. Test sound wood for baseline compare to suspect areas. Document fracture loads conditions species. Use to support conclusions not as sole determinant.		
60	YES	Biomech	Included bark in a union is structurally weak because:	It looks unsightly	Bark cannot form strong connections like wood	It indicates decay is present	The union is too wide	1	Bark between stems prevents fusion of wood - creates slip plane with no structural connection or interlocking wood fibers	Strong unions have intergrown wood tissue. Included bark keeps stems separate resulting in weak attachment prone to splitting under load	Included bark mechanics: NORMAL UNION - Stems join early branch bark ridge narrow wood fuses across junction creating continuous tissue strong connection.<br>INCLUDED BARK UNION - Stems remain separate bark trapped between no wood fusion bark acts as slip plane weak attachment.<br>Why bark can't bond: Bark is dead tissue outer protective layer. Wood bonds to wood through living cambium creating interlocking cells. Bark-to-bark contact creates NO BOND just touching surfaces.<br>Visual identification: NARROW ANGLE between stems (less than 45° often less than 30°). BARK RIDGE raised elongated pointing INTO union (not out like normal). SEAM visible where stems meet bark visible in crack. SOMETIMES hidden - Stems appear joined but bark embedded internally.<br>Failure mechanics: Union loaded (wind weight) stems try to spread apart. Bark provides NO tensile resistance just friction. Load exceeds friction and stems separate. Failure occurs along bark plane clean split.<br>Progressive development: Union starts weak. Loading causes slight movement. Bark ridge extends deeper over time. Eventually full separation occurs sudden catastrophic failure.<br>Risk factors increasing failure likelihood: HEAVY LOADS - Large co-dominant stems equal mass and high loads on union. ASYMMETRIC - One stem much larger or different crown causes uneven loading. FORK ANGLE - Narrower angle (more acute) equals higher stress concentration. LENGTH - Long union (extended along stem) may share loads better than short.<br>Assessment: Visual inspection for bark ridge configuration. Probe with thin blade - if penetrates deeply bark included. Compare stem diameters - 1:1 ratio concerning. Check for movement cracks progressive opening. Consider loading - wind exposure sail area.<br>Management options: REDUCTION - Remove or reduce subordinate stem reduces load on union. CABLING - Install cable above union limits movement shares load. May slow progressive failure. WARNING: Doesn't fix weakness cable can fail. REMOVAL - If high-value target and clear weakness removal safest. MONITOR - If low consequence targets document and observe.<br>Prevention: Prune to establish dominance early maintain 2:1 ratio. Remove co-dominants with narrow angles while small.		
61	YES	Risk	The likelihood of a tree failure occurring within a stated time frame is affected most by:	The tree species only	Both tree condition and environmental loading	Target proximity	Property value	1	Likelihood combines tree's structural condition (resistance) and loading environment (wind exposure site weather extremes) both are essential to predict failure probability	A weak tree in sheltered site may be lower likelihood than sound tree in severe exposure. Both intrinsic and extrinsic factors determine failure probability	Components of failure likelihood: TREE CONDITION (Resistance factors) - Defects present decay extent cavity size crack severity. Structural form taper buttressing fork angles. Root plate integrity anchorage. Overall vigor health adaptive growth. Species characteristics wood strength brittleness.<br>ENVIRONMENTAL LOADING (Load factors) - Wind exposure site shelter topography wind speeds. Typical weather patterns storm frequency. Snow/ice loading in relevant climates. Soil conditions (wet = reduced anchorage). Dynamic loads (vehicle impact).<br>Interaction: STRONG TREE + LOW LOADING = Very low likelihood (sound tree sheltered site). WEAK TREE + LOW LOADING = Low-moderate likelihood (may survive despite defects). STRONG TREE + HIGH LOADING = Low-moderate likelihood (may still fail under extreme loads). WEAK TREE + HIGH LOADING = High-very high likelihood (both factors adverse).<br>Assessment process: Evaluate TREE - conduct VTA resistograph tomography as needed. Evaluate SITE - wind exposure topography shelter soil. Consider CLIMATE - typical and extreme weather. Integrate both = likelihood rating (imminent probable possible improbable).<br>Common mistakes: Assessing tree only without considering loading environment. Assuming all sound trees are low likelihood (exposed sites increase risk). Ignoring site-specific factors (microclimate local weather patterns).<br>Time frame consideration: Likelihood given for specific period (1 year typically). Longer time frames increase likelihood (decay progresses weather extremes likely). Shorter time frames decrease likelihood (unless imminent failure).<br>Example: Moderate decay + moderate exposure = possible failure in 1 year moderate likelihood. Same tree + 5 years = probable failure higher likelihood as decay advances.<br>Management implications: Can reduce likelihood by reducing LOAD (prune remove targets) OR improving CONDITION (stabilize monitor). Can't easily change wind exposure but can modify tree to reduce sail area.'		
62	YES	Assessment	Root collar excavation is primarily used to:	Improve drainage	Expose and inspect root flare and basal roots	Remove competing vegetation	Apply fertilizer	1	Root collar excavation uses air tools or water to expose root flare and structural roots for inspection of girdling roots decay damage and overall root plate condition	Non-destructive inspection of normally hidden critical root zone. Reveals problems invisible from surface like girdling roots root decay poor architecture	Root collar excavation methods: AIR SPADE - Supersonic air jet (120+ psi) loosens soil without damaging roots. Preferred method safest for roots.<br>WATER JET - High-pressure water excavates soil. Effective but may damage fine roots more than air.<br>MANUAL - Careful hand excavation around base. Slow but works for small areas.<br>Indications for excavation: SUSPECTED GIRDLING ROOTS - Poor crown vigor lean base swelling. Stem emerging straight from ground without flare. Recent transplants or nursery stock. DECAY ASSESSMENT - Confirm extent of root collar decay. Inspect root plate integrity after storm damage. Follow fungal sporophores to source. ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS - Evaluate root plate development on slopes or problem soils. Determine root distribution before construction. DECLINE DIAGNOSIS - Tree declining no obvious cause check for buried roots stem girdling roots root rot.<br>Procedure: Clear vegetation mulch from base. Begin 2-3 feet from stem work inward. Excavate to expose root flare and major structural roots (top 12-18 inches typically). INSPECT - Root distribution symmetry. Girdling or circling roots. Decay cankers wounds. Proper flare development. Depth - should see WHERE roots emerge from trunk. DOCUMENT - Photos measurements notes. Replace soil after inspection or leave exposed if girdling roots removed.<br>Findings interpretation: PROPER FLARE - Wide buttressed base clear transition from stem to roots roots radiating outward. BURIED - Stem straight into soil no visible flare roots emerge below grade. Usually planted too deep or soil added. GIRDLING ROOTS - Root(s) crossing stem or other roots causing constriction. Remove if possible. DECAY - Soft wood fungal presence cavities in root collar. POOR ARCHITECTURE - All roots on one side kinked roots poor distribution.<br>Actions after excavation: Remove girdling roots if feasible. Correct planting depth if buried (leave exposed or remove excess soil). Monitor decay if found (may require treatment or removal decision). Document for future reference.<br>Benefits: Reveals critical hidden problems. Many tree failures start in root zone inspection essential. Can guide management (pruning removal protection). Can improve tree condition if problems corrected (girdling roots removed proper depth restored).		
63	YES	Biomech	A tree with significant lean but well-developed buttressing on the tension side and no recent movement is:	At imminent failure risk	Likely stable and adapted to the lean	Losing its root plate	Requiring immediate removal	1	Long-established leans with visible adaptive growth (buttressing reaction wood eccentric rings) show successful adaptation tree has remodeled to accommodate loading	Leaning trees without adaptive growth are concerning. Leaning trees WITH compensation are generally stable barring additional stress or damage	Adaptive lean characteristics: BUTTRESS DEVELOPMENT - Enhanced root buttressing on tension side (usually downhill). Larger diameter buttresses flanges ribs.<br>ROOT ARCHITECTURE - Deeper more extensive roots on tension side resist uplift. Compression roots on opposite side resist sliding.<br>STEM GROWTH - Reaction wood (tension wood in broadleaves) on tension side pulls stem. Eccentric growth rings wider on loaded sides.<br>STABLE LEAN ANGLE - No increase in lean over time (compare to old photos records).<br>CROWN REORIENTATION - Leader curves upward crown compensates for lean.<br>Signs of ADAPTED vs FAILING lean: ADAPTED (Lower risk) - Gradual long-standing lean. Visible buttressing and compensatory growth. No soil cracks or root plate movement. Healthy crown. Historical photos show same angle. FAILING (High risk) - Recent lean increase. NO buttressing or compensation visible. Soil cracks root plate lifting. Declining crown. Recent storm wind event caused change.<br>Assessment protocol: DOCUMENT current lean angle (clinometer baseline photos). CHECK for adaptive growth (buttress quality eccentric rings reaction wood). INVESTIGATE root plate (probe for movement excavate if necessary). COMPARE to historical - old photos previous reports. TEST for movement (push tree feel for rocking pulling test if warranted). EVALUATE loading (wind exposure soil conditions crown weight).<br>Management of adapted leans: MONITOR - Periodic inspection photos measure lean angle. Watch for changes. ACCEPT - If low-consequence targets and stable adaptation lean is not automatic problem. PROTECT root zone - Essential maintain buttressing prevent root damage. REDUCE load IF concerned - Crown prune reduce sail area but maintain health. REMOVE - If high targets or concern about stability despite adaptation.<br>Historical context: Many veteran trees have significant leans with centuries of stability. Lean is NORMAL for many trees not inherently bad. Failure risk depends on ADAPTATION not lean angle alone.<br>Urban considerations: Lean toward targets more concerning. Public perception (looks scary) may drive management even if structurally sound. Document and explain adaptation to clients.		
64	YES	Risk	A tree risk assessment should be updated when:	Every single year regardless of conditions	Site conditions targets or tree condition changes significantly	Never once completed	Only if the tree is removed	1	Risk assessments are point-in-time evaluations - re-assessment needed when conditions change that affect likelihood or consequence ratings	Trees are dynamic conditions change. Targets change. Site changes. Risk is not static so assessment must be updated as warranted	Triggers for re-assessment: TREE CONDITION CHANGES - Storm damage (broken branches cracks). Disease or pest infestation observed. Sudden decline in crown condition. New sporophores or visible decay. Crown work performed (pruning structural change).<br>SIGNIFICANT TIME - Even without apparent change re-assess every 2-5 years. Decay progresses defects develop over time. Longer for young healthy trees shorter for declining or defective. After extreme weather events.<br>TARGET CHANGES - New construction buildings roads. Changed use patterns (new playground parking). Increased occupancy (busy area). Removal or addition of nearby targets.<br>SITE CHANGES - Adjacent tree removal increases wind exposure. Soil grade changes root damage. Drainage changes affecting soil. Construction in root zone. New stressors nearby.<br>Standard re-assessment intervals: HIGH-RISK trees - Annually or after major storms. Priority monitoring. MODERATE-RISK trees - Every 2-3 years unless changes observed. LOW-RISK trees - Every 3-5 years routine monitoring sufficient. VETERAN/HIGH-VALUE trees - More frequent regardless of risk due to value.<br>Post-mitigation assessment: After pruning cabling or other work - reassess to document residual risk. Verify mitigation achieved intended risk reduction. Determine if additional measures needed.<br>Documentation: Previous assessment provides baseline. New assessment notes changes progression. Dates of all assessments tracked. Shows ongoing monitoring and due diligence.<br>Legal considerations: Current assessment demonstrates awareness of conditions. Old outdated assessment may be worse than none if conditions changed. Regular re-assessment shows professional standard of care. Incident occurs - documented monitoring history provides defense.<br>Red flags requiring immediate re-assessment: Sudden lean development or increase. Soil cracks around base. Crown decline or dieback. Fungal sporophores appearing. Storm damage however minor. Root zone disturbance. Change in targets especially increased risk.<br>Flexibility: Not every tree needs annual assessment. Risk-based frequency - highest risk monitored most closely. Professional judgment on appropriate intervals.		
65	YES	Assessment	The most important reason for documenting tree risk assessments is:	To increase billable hours	To provide records for legal defensibility and management tracking	To impress clients with paperwork	To meet arbitrary standards	1	Documentation provides evidence of professional assessment systematic evaluation and risk-based decision making essential for legal protection management continuity and demonstrating duty of care	Without documentation there's no proof you assessed or what you found. Critical for liability protection and professional practice standards	Documentation essentials: TREE IDENTIFICATION - Location (address GPS coordinates site map). Species. Measurements (DBH height crown spread). Photos (general and defects). Date of assessment assessor name.<br>CONDITION ASSESSMENT - Health and vitality. Structural defects decay cavities cracks unions. Root plate condition. Crown condition.<br>RISK EVALUATION - Targets identified and rated. Likelihood rating (imminent probable possible improbable). Consequence rating (severe significant minor negligible). Overall risk rating (extreme high moderate low).<br>RECOMMENDATIONS - Mitigation options presented. Priority and time frame. Estimated costs if applicable.<br>RATIONALE - Why you reached your conclusions. References to standards methods used. Limitations of assessment.<br>Legal importance: DUTY OF CARE - Documentation shows you acted responsibly assessed hazards. STANDARD OF PRACTICE - Demonstrates professional approach systematic evaluation. LIABILITY DEFENSE - If incident occurs records show you identified evaluated and recommended appropriately. Prove you weren't negligent. CONTINUITY - Other professionals can review understand your assessment.<br>Management benefits: TRACKING - Compare assessments over time monitor changes. PRIORITIZATION - Risk ratings guide work scheduling budgeting. COMMUNICATION - Clear written records inform property owners managers. WORK ORDERS - Recommendations become actionable tasks.<br>Documentation methods: WRITTEN REPORTS - Formal detailed narrative reports for high-value or complex trees. FORMS/CHECKLISTS - Standardized data collection for routine surveys. SOFTWARE - Digital tree inventory platforms with risk modules. PHOTOS - Essential for defects reference over time. Maps showing locations risk zones.<br>Minimum documentation: What you observed. What you concluded. What you recommended. Date and assessor.<br>Retention: Keep records long-term (7-10+ years minimum). May need to reference years later.<br>Common mistakes: Inadequate detail (too vague to be useful). No photos (can't verify conditions later). Missing recommendations (identified problem but no action). No follow-up (recommendations made but not tracked).<br>Quality documentation: Specific and detailed not generic. Uses proper terminology. Cites relevant standards. Includes supporting data (measurements test results). Clear recommendations with priority.<br>Professional standard: Documented assessment is EXPECTED practice. Lack of documentation can be viewed as negligent. Courts recognize documentation as evidence of competence.		
66	YES	Defect	A crack that extends completely through the stem and shows movement is classified as:	Superficial surface crack	Critical structural defect requiring urgent action	Normal stress response	Cosmetic issue only	1	Complete cracks that show movement indicate progressive failure and imminent risk of collapse	The stem is losing integrity and cannot resist normal loads. Movement proves the crack is active and propagating. Failure could occur at any time especially under wind or snow loading	Complete crack characteristics: Extends through full diameter visible on opposite sides may show differential movement bark edges separated wood fibrous or torn.<br>Movement indicators: Gap width changes with wind fresh wood exposed crack propagating bark lifting at edges relative displacement of stem sections.<br>Why critically dangerous: Stem acting as two separate pieces hinge effect concentrates stress crack propagates rapidly under load minimal warning before complete failure.<br>Assessment protocol: Document crack extent length depth movement measure gap width check for propagation compare to previous inspections if available assume imminent failure until proven otherwise.<br>Management: IMMEDIATE action required barriers exclusion zones emergency removal or support if retention essential.<br>Risk factors: High winds snow/ice loading any additional stress.<br>Never delay - these failures are sudden and catastrophic		
67	YES	Defect	Frost cracks typically appear as:	Horizontal rings around stem	Vertical splits on south or southwest facing stem	Random branching patterns	Spiral wounds	1	Frost cracks form vertically on the side exposed to temperature extremes typically south or southwest aspects where sun causes rapid temperature fluctuations	Repeated freeze-thaw cycles cause wood to split along grain. Cracks may close in summer and reopen in winter. Can weaken stem if extensive but often compartmentalized	Formation mechanism: Winter sun warms south/southwest bark daytime. Rapid cooling at night causes contraction. Wood splits vertically along weakest grain. Repeated annually - crack deepens.<br>Characteristics: Vertical orientation 1-3m length smooth edges inside callus rolls form along edges over years may close partially in growing season reopen in winter.<br>Species susceptibility: Thin-barked species most vulnerable - beech sycamore horse chestnut lime. Young stems more affected.<br>Assessment: Measure depth and length check for associated decay probe for soft wood behind callus note if open or closed currently compare to previous years.<br>Risk evaluation: Usually LOW risk if compartmentalized and callused. MODERATE risk if decay present or crack very deep. Monitor for propagation.<br>Management: Usually retain and monitor. Remove only if decay extensive or crack compromising large percentage of stem.<br>Prevent by wrapping young stems in winter	none	
68	YES	Soil	Which soil pH range is generally optimal for most temperate tree species?	3.5-4.5 (very acidic)	5.5-7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral)	7.5-8.5 (alkaline)	Above 9.0 (very alkaline)	1	Most temperate trees thrive in slightly acidic to neutral soils where nutrient availability is optimized and aluminum toxicity is avoided	Extreme pH affects nutrient availability microbial activity and can cause toxicity. Most nutrients available in 5.5-7.0 range. Outside this range deficiencies or toxicities occur	Nutrient availability by pH: ACIDIC below 5.5 - Iron manganese aluminum MORE available copper zinc LESS available. Phosphorus locked up. Aluminum toxicity damages roots.<br>OPTIMAL 5.5-7.0 - All major nutrients available nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium.<br>ALKALINE above 7.5 - Iron manganese zinc LESS available. Phosphorus locked up by calcium. Chlorosis common.<br>Species adaptations: Calcicoles prefer alkaline - beech ash field maple yew whitebeam. Calcifuges prefer acidic - oak birch sweet chestnut Scots pine. Most species adaptable within 5.5-7.5.<br>Problems from extreme pH: VERY ACIDIC - Aluminum toxicity manganese toxicity nutrient deficiencies weak root growth. VERY ALKALINE - Iron chlorosis manganese deficiency phosphorus deficiency poor growth.<br>Assessment: Soil test kits measure pH. Visual symptoms - chlorosis suggests alkaline nutrient deficiency.<br>Management: Amend soil if possible (lime raises pH sulfur lowers pH) choose appropriate species for site pH mulch with appropriate materials	none	
69	YES	Defect	Girdling roots are most commonly caused by:	Natural root grafting	Planting too deep or circling roots from containers	Wind damage	Fungal infection	1	Girdling roots develop when trees are planted too deep or container-grown roots circle and continue that pattern after planting	Root collar buried or circling roots are not corrected at planting. Roots grow across stem base constricting cambium and vascular tissue. Progressive strangulation occurs	Formation causes: PRIMARY - Container-grown stock with circling roots planted without correction. Roots maintain circular pattern grow across stem.<br>SECONDARY - Planting too deep. Adventitious roots form above original root collar circle the buried stem. Mulch/soil added post-planting burying root flare.<br>Visual symptoms: Stem emerges straight from ground without flare base may look swollen above constriction lean developing poor growth and crown condition compression/indentation where root crosses stem.<br>Internal effects: Cambium crushed vascular tissue compressed water and nutrient transport restricted girdling worsens over time tree declines or develops instability.<br>Detection: Root collar excavation essential. Remove soil to expose root flare and junction. Probe around circumference. Most girdling roots within top 30cm.<br>Species susceptibility: Maples Norway maple silver maple especially prone. Lindens oaks also common. Any species if planted incorrectly.<br>Management: YOUNG trees - Remove girdling root if possible. Cut on both sides of stem contact. MATURE trees - May be too late. Removal may destabilize. Assess risk vs benefit.<br>Prevention: Inspect root ball at planting cut circling roots plant at proper depth ensure root flare exposed avoid soil/mulch against trunk	none	
70	YES	Veteran	Ancient or veteran trees are primarily valuable because they:	Have high timber value	Provide irreplaceable ecological niches and biodiversity	Are always structurally sound	Grow faster than young trees	1	Veteran trees provide habitat features that take centuries to develop supporting specialized species that depend on deadwood cavities and specific microhabitats	Ancient trees are biodiversity hotspots. Deadwood fungi rare lichens invertebrates bats birds all depend on features only found in old trees. Irreplaceable in human timescales	Ecological value: DEADWOOD - Heart rot cavities provide bat roosts bird nesting insect habitat. Decaying wood supports saproxylic beetles fungi.<br>BARK - Fissured ancient bark hosts rare lichens bryophytes invertebrates.<br>STRUCTURE - Large limbs hollows crevices provide unique niches.<br>CONTINUITY - Centuries of occupation by species. Genetic reservoirs.<br>Habitat features found ONLY in veterans: Large cavities from extensive heart rot water-filled rot holes sap runs exposed heartwood Phoenix crowns (regrowth from old pollards) veteran bark deeply fissured.<br>Species dependent on veterans: Violet click beetle noble chafer stag beetle numerous hoverflies rare lichens specialist fungi bats (soprano pipistrelle brown long-eared).<br>Management principles: RETENTION paramount. Accept high risk if targets allow. Structural defects are HABITAT not just defects. Dynamic load reduction (sensitive pruning) rather than removal. Protect root zone absolutely. Avoid disturbance. Monitor but intervene minimally.<br>Legal protection: Ancient trees often protected by TPOs planning policy biodiversity legislation. Removal requires exceptional justification.<br>Value hierarchy: Ecological value EXCEEDS amenity or safety concerns in many cases. Each ancient tree is irreplaceable	none	
71	YES	Biomech	The primary function of buttress roots is to:	Absorb water more efficiently	Resist overturning and provide mechanical stability	Store nutrients	Prevent soil erosion only	1	Buttress roots provide lateral stability resisting overturning forces and distributing stem loads into the soil	Buttresses are tension and compression members that transfer wind loads from stem to soil. Essential for stability especially in species with shallow root systems or unstable soils	Biomechanical function: TENSION RESISTANCE - Buttresses on leeward side (away from lean/wind) resist uplift. Roots in tension like cables.<br>COMPRESSION RESISTANCE - Buttresses on windward side resist compression loads. Struts pushing into soil.<br>MOMENT REDUCTION - Buttresses extend lever arm of root plate. Reduces overturning moment.<br>Development patterns: Form in response to directional loading. Larger on loaded sides. Eccentric development normal on slopes or exposed sites.<br>Species with prominent buttresses: Beech especially on shallow soils over chalk Fagus sylvatica characteristic. Many tropical species Ficus spp. large buttresses. Some temperate species on unstable sites.<br>Damage implications: LOSS OF BUTTRESS - Root decay excavation damage construction cuts. Reduces stability significantly. Loss on one side equals asymmetric loading.<br>ASSESSMENT - Excavate to inspect buttress integrity. Check for decay cavities. Test root plate movement.<br>Risk factors: Buttress decay more critical than general root decay. Loss on tension side very serious.<br>Failure mode: Tree overturns by rotating on remaining buttresses until soil fails or roots break	none	
72	YES	Defect	Sunken or necrotic bark patches are typically indicative of:	Healthy cambium response	Dead cambium from injury disease or environmental stress	Normal seasonal variation	Recent pruning	1	Sunken bark indicates dead cambium beneath often from canker diseases winter injury sunscald or physical damage	Dead cambium cannot transport nutrients or add growth. Area becomes depressed as surrounding living tissue continues to grow. May be entry point for decay	Causes: CANKER DISEASES - Fungal or bacterial pathogens kill cambium. Nectria Phytophthora Pseudomonas cause sunken lesions.<br>ENVIRONMENTAL - Winter injury sunscald frost damage drought stress.<br>MECHANICAL - Impact wounds bark stripping.<br>PHYSIOLOGICAL - Lightning strike chemical damage.<br>Appearance: Bark sunken below surrounding surface often cracked or fissured darker discoloration sometimes exudate (bleeding) callus rolls form at margins as tree attempts to close wound.<br>Progression: ACTIVE CANKERS - Expanding annually. Pathogen kills cambium faster than tree can close wound. Sunken area enlarges. INACTIVE/HEALING - Callus forming wound closing. No expansion. Old injury compartmentalized.<br>Assessment: Probe edges to determine if active measure dimensions compare to previous inspections if available identify cause (pathogen vs environmental).<br>Associated risks: GIRDLING - Canker encircling stem equals death above that point. DECAY ENTRY - Dead cambium allows fungal colonization. Internal decay may develop. STRUCTURAL - Large cankers weaken stem if extensive.<br>Risk varies by location size and activity: SMALL INACTIVE - LOW risk. Monitor. LARGE ACTIVE - MODERATE to HIGH risk especially if girdling or decay present. GIRDLING - EXTREME risk if near complete	none	
73	YES	Soil	Soil compaction in the root zone most directly damages trees by:	Increasing nutrient availability	Reducing oxygen availability and restricting root growth	Improving drainage	Raising soil pH	1	Compaction eliminates air-filled pore spaces preventing oxygen diffusion to roots and creating physical barrier to root penetration	Roots require oxygen for respiration. Compacted soil becomes anaerobic. Roots cannot penetrate dense soil. Result: shallow root system poor anchorage reduced vigor decline	Compaction effects: PHYSICAL BARRIER - Soil particles compressed. Roots cannot push through. Penetrometer resistance greater than 2-3 MPa equals effective barrier. Root systems remain shallow and restricted.<br>OXYGEN DEPLETION - Macro-pores eliminated. Remaining pores fill with water. Oxygen cannot diffuse. Anaerobic conditions develop. Roots suffocate.<br>REDUCED WATER INFILTRATION - Water cannot penetrate compacted layer. Runoff increases. Drought stress worsens despite rain.<br>POOR DRAINAGE - Compacted soil holds water. Saturated conditions persist. Root rot favored.<br>Symptoms in trees: Reduced growth small leaves short shoots thin crown chlorosis early autumn color premature leaf drop dieback poor wound closure increased susceptibility to pests/diseases.<br>Vulnerable situations: Construction traffic over root zone heavy equipment parking areas foot traffic on popular routes.<br>Species sensitivity: Beech very sensitive oak moderately sensitive London plane relatively tolerant willows poplars tolerant of wet but not compacted.<br>Assessment: Penetrometer test bulk density test visual inspection (surface crusting poor grass growth puddles).<br>Management: PREVENT - Exclude traffic from root zones barriers fencing protective mulch. REMEDIATE - Radial trenching soil replacement air spading vertical mulching. Results vary - prevention always better	none	
74	YES	WinterID	In winter how can you distinguish oak (Quercus robur) from ash (Fraxinus excelsior)?	Oak has opposite buds; ash has alternate	Oak has alternate buds; ash has opposite	Both have opposite buds	Both have alternate buds	1	Oak has alternate bud arrangement while ash has opposite buds - this is a fundamental difference visible year-round	Bud arrangement is reliable for winter ID. Opposite buds are less common (ash maple horse chestnut dogwood). Most trees including oak have alternate buds	Oak winter features: BUDS - Alternate arrangement clustered at twig tips small 3-5mm brown multiple buds at tip.<br>BARK - Deeply fissured characteristic ridged pattern dark grey-brown.<br>TWIGS - Slender brown slightly angular. Sometimes retains dead leaves through winter (marcescence).<br>FORM - Broad spreading crown massive branches irregular outline.<br>Ash winter features: BUDS - Opposite arrangement terminal bud distinctive BLACK pyramid shape large 5-10mm. LATERAL buds also black opposite pairs.<br>BARK - Pale grey smooth when young becoming fissured with age distinctive diamond pattern.<br>TWIGS - Stout grey-green smooth slightly flattened at nodes.<br>FORM - Upright relatively narrow crown branches ascending.<br>Other identification features: Oak - Acorn cups persisting bark very dark and ridged marcescent leaves common. Ash - Black buds DIAGNOSTIC pale bark keys (winged seeds) often persist.<br>Field tip: BLACK BUDS equals ash almost certainly. Clustered small brown buds alternate equals oak likely. Check bark for confirmation.<br>Common confusion: Young ash bark smoother than oak. Mature both fissured but ash paler with diamond pattern oak darker with vertical ridges	none	
75	YES	Defect	A cavity with smooth hard walls and no punk or frass indicates:	Active decay with fungi present	Old well-compartmentalized decay that has stopped progressing	Recent mechanical damage	Active insect infestation	1	Smooth hard cavity walls show successful compartmentalization - decay has been walled off and dried out no longer actively progressing	Tree has effectively stopped decay spread. Walls are hard and sound. Cavity is stable. Much less concerning than active soft decay with ongoing fungal activity	Cavity assessment: INACTIVE/OLD DECAY - Walls hard smooth dry no soft or punky wood no fungal mycelium no fresh frass no active decomposition. Decay arrested by CODIT barriers.<br>ACTIVE DECAY - Walls soft or spongy wet or damp fungal mycelium visible distinctive odor wood crumbles easily. Decay progressing.<br>Why smooth hard cavities less risky: Decay is NOT expanding. Remaining shell thickness is STABLE. Tree has successfully compartmentalized. Structural capacity is not declining further.<br>Risk depends on SHELL THICKNESS not cavity presence: Measure residual wall thickness calculate t/R ratio. Adequate shell (t/R greater than 0.3) equals tree stable despite cavity. Inadequate shell equals risk regardless of decay activity.<br>Assessment protocol: Visual inspection probe walls with tool (hard vs soft) check for moisture fungal signs measure shell thickness multiple radii tomography if high value/high risk.<br>Cavity types: HISTORIC WOUNDS - Old branch stubs pruning cuts damage healed over decades. Often smooth and dry. ROT HOLES - Heart rot created cavity water accumulates provides habitat. May be active or inactive.<br>Management: Inactive cavities with adequate shell - RETAIN and monitor. Do NOT fill cavities - prevents inspection and may trap moisture. Active decay - Assess shell adequacy may require mitigation or removal	none	
76	YES	Veteran	Pollarding is primarily practiced to:	Increase timber production	Extend tree lifespan and produce repeated harvests of small wood	Encourage flowering	Improve root growth	1	Pollarding removes the crown at a set height creating a bolling that resprouts. Regular cutting maintains the tree in a juvenile state extending lifespan for centuries	Pollarding prevents trees from reaching full size. Repeated cutting creates distinctive swollen head (bolling). New shoots harvested cyclically. Traditional management for wood fuel fencing livestock browse	Pollarding system: CUT HEIGHT - Typically 2-3m above ground. Above livestock browse height.<br>CYCLE - Cut every 5-20 years depending on species use. Regrowth harvested repeatedly.<br>FORM - Bolling (swollen head) develops. Multiple shoots sprout from bolling. Distinctive candelabra appearance.<br>Benefits: LONGEVITY - Trees live far longer than if allowed to mature. Many pollards 500+ years old. SAFETY - Reduced size/weight. Less wind loading. Suitable for confined spaces. PRODUCTION - Continuous yield of small wood without killing tree.<br>Veteran pollards: ABANDONED POLLARDS - Not cut for decades/centuries. Heavy regrowth on aged bolling. High ecological value but structural risk. RESTORATION - Can resume cutting carefully. Gradual reduction of heavy poles.<br>Species commonly pollarded: Willow crack willow white willow traditional for basketry. Lime common in avenues and parks. Ash oak hornbeam historically for wood. London plane urban pollarding common.<br>Structural concerns: BOLLING DECAY - Hollow centres common in old pollards. Assess shell thickness. HEAVY REGROWTH - Long poles on old bolling high moment loads. Failure risk at bolling junction. RESTORATION SHOCK - Sudden heavy cutting of long-abandoned pollard can kill tree. Phased reduction safer	none	
77	YES	Biomech	In assessing a union the aspect ratio (ratio of union length to stem diameter) affects strength because:	Longer unions have less surface area	Longer unions distribute stress over greater distance reducing risk	Shorter unions are always stronger	Aspect ratio is irrelevant	1	Longer unions (high aspect ratio) share loads over more surface area reducing stress concentration at any single point	Short unions concentrate stress. Long unions spread stress along length. Aspect ratio greater than 2:1 generally stronger than less than 2:1. Combine with diameter ratio for full assessment	Union strength factors: ASPECT RATIO - Union length divided by stem diameter. Greater than 2:1 preferred. Longer equals more wood-to-wood contact. Stress distributed over length.<br>DIAMETER RATIO - Dominant to subordinate stem. Greater than 2:1 preferred. Subordinate should be clearly smaller.<br>INCLUDED BARK - Presence significantly weakens union regardless of other factors.<br>ANGLE - Narrow angles (less than 45°) weaker than wide angles (greater than 60°).<br>Why long unions stronger: Shear stress spread over larger area. Each unit area experiences less stress. Failure less likely.<br>Short unions: Stress concentrated in small zone. High stress per unit area. Crack initiation more likely. Failure sudden.<br>Assessment example: Union 40cm long on 20cm diameter stem. Aspect ratio 40/20 equals 2:1. ACCEPTABLE if no included bark and good diameter ratio. Union 10cm long on 20cm diameter stem. Aspect ratio 10/20 equals 0.5:1. CONCERNING - short union concentrates stress. Check carefully for cracks.<br>Combined analysis: BEST - Long union (high aspect ratio) good diameter ratio (greater than 2:1) wide angle (greater than 60°) no included bark. WORST - Short union (low aspect ratio) co-dominant stems (1:1 diameter ratio) narrow angle (less than 45°) included bark present	none	
78	YES	Soil	Which condition is most likely to cause iron chlorosis in trees?	Very acidic soil	High alkaline soil (high pH)	Well-drained sandy soil	High organic matter	1	Iron becomes unavailable in alkaline soils above pH 7.5 leading to interveinal chlorosis as trees cannot absorb sufficient iron for chlorophyll production	Iron solubility decreases dramatically as pH rises. In alkaline soils iron precipitates as insoluble compounds. Roots cannot take it up. Leaves become chlorotic (yellow between veins)	Iron chlorosis mechanism: ALKALINE SOIL - pH above 7.5. Iron forms insoluble ferric compounds. Roots cannot absorb.<br>SYMPTOMS - Interveinal chlorosis. Leaf veins remain green tissue between veins turns yellow. Young leaves affected first (iron not mobile in plant). Severe cases - entire leaf yellow or white. Leaf scorch. Dieback.<br>Susceptible species: Acid-loving plants (calcifuges) most affected - Oak especially pin oak and red oak. Sweet chestnut. Rhododendrons azaleas (ornamental but illustrative). Some fruit trees.<br>Tolerant species: Ash beech field maple yew whitebeam (calcicoles) tolerate alkaline soils.<br>Diagnosis: Visual symptoms - interveinal chlorosis pattern. Soil test - pH above 7.5. Leaf analysis - low iron content. Site history - alkaline soils chalky soils lime-rich soils construction rubble.<br>Management: CORRECT SOIL pH - Sulfur application lowers pH slowly. Iron sulfate provides iron AND lowers pH. CHELATED IRON - Foliar spray or soil drench. Temporary relief symptoms return. MULCH - Acidic mulch (pine needles composted oak leaves) helps slightly. SPECIES SELECTION - Plant appropriate species for site pH. Don't plant calcifuges on alkaline sites.<br>Prevention better than cure: Soil test before planting. Choose suitable species. Avoid raising pH with lime near acid-loving trees	none

Small alternate buds	Large sticky opposite buds with horseshoe-shaped leaf scars	Smooth grey bark	Thorns on branches	1	Horse chestnut has very distinctive large sticky opposite buds and horseshoe-shaped leaf scars with nail holes visible in winter	The buds are unmistakable - large resinous sticky opposite arrangement. Leaf scars below buds resemble horseshoes complete with nail hole marks from vascular bundles	Horse chestnut winter ID: BUDS - Opposite arrangement very large (15-30mm) long and pointed sticky resinous coating dark red-brown scales. Terminal bud especially large.<br>LEAF SCARS - Horseshoe shape distinctive. 5-9 vascular bundle scars visible (the nails in horseshoe). Located below buds.<br>BARK - Grey-brown flaking in irregular plates. Becomes more fissured with age.<br>TWIGS - Stout grey-brown.<br>FORM - Large spreading crown. Often low-branched.<br>Confusion species: OTHER OPPOSITE BUDS - Ash (black buds smaller). Maples (smaller buds not sticky). Sycamore (green buds). None have horseshoe scars.<br>Diagnostic features: HORSESHOE SCARS - Unique to horse chestnut. Visible on 1-2 year old twigs. LARGE STICKY BUDS - Resinous coating distinctive. Touch feels tacky. SIZE - Horse chestnut buds much larger than other opposite-budded trees.<br>Additional clues: Conkers (seeds) or their spiky cases may persist on ground. Bark pattern. Large compound leaves in litter (7 leaflets palmate).<br>Field identification: If you see LARGE STICKY BUDS OPPOSITE with HORSESHOE SCARS it is horse chestnut. No other tree has this combination	none	
80	YES	Defect	Basal flare absence (stem entering ground without visible root flare) most commonly indicates:	Excellent root development	Planting too deep or soil accumulation burying the root collar	Superior anchorage	Normal growth in clay soils	1	Trees should have visible flare where trunk meets roots. Absence indicates root collar is buried leading to poor health girdling roots and potential stability issues	Buried root collar causes stress prevents gas exchange encourages adventitious roots that may girdle promotes decay. Trees evolved with root flare exposed - burial is abnormal and harmful	Normal vs buried root collar: NORMAL - Trunk diameter increases noticeably at ground level. Transition from stem to buttress roots visible. Root flare exposed and prominent.<br>BURIED - Stem appears to go straight into ground like telephone pole. No flare visible. Roots emerge below grade.<br>Causes of burial: PLANTED TOO DEEP - Container or root ball set too low. Soil above root collar. SOIL ADDED - Mulch soil fill added after planting. Landscaping construction grade changes. SETTLING - Tree settles after planting especially in loose backfill.<br>Problems caused: STRESS - Reduced gas exchange root suffocation. GIRDLING ROOTS - Adventitious roots form on buried stem circle trunk. DECAY - Bark remains moist buried promotes disease and decay. POOR GROWTH - Overall decline thin crown reduced vigor.<br>Detection: Excavate around base carefully. Remove soil until root flare found. May need to dig 20-30cm down.<br>Species susceptibility: All species affected. Maples particularly prone to girdling root development. Oaks ashes also commonly affected.<br>Management: YOUNG TREES - Excavate and replant at correct depth if possible. Remove excess soil permanently. ESTABLISHED TREES - Excavate root collar expose flare keep it exposed. Remove girdling roots if present. May improve health significantly.<br>Prevention: Plant at proper depth ensure root flare visible at planting avoid mulch/soil against trunk maintain exposed flare	none	
81	YES	Veteran	Phoenix crowns in pollarded trees indicate:	Recent storm damage requiring removal	Successful regeneration showing tree vitality	Disease and decline	Immediate failure risk	1	Phoenix crown is vigorous new growth from old pollard bolling after period of neglect - indicates the tree retains vitality and capacity to produce new shoots	Named for the phoenix rising from ashes. Shows life in ancient trees. Heavy regrowth on old bolling is positive sign of vigor though creates management challenges	Phoenix crown characteristics: CONTEXT - Old pollard not cut for many decades or centuries.<br>FORM - Multiple vigorous poles sprouting from ancient bolling. Dense crown of relatively young wood on very old base.<br>VITALITY INDICATOR - Demonstrates tree is alive and responsive despite age. Strong growth positive sign.<br>Structural considerations: HEAVY LOADING - Long poles on old bolling create high moment loads. Weight concentrated at bolling junction. LEVERAGE - Poles act as long lever arms. Wind loading significant. FAILURE RISK - Bolling-pole junction is stress concentration. Poles may fail at base especially in wind. Old bolling may have extensive heart rot.<br>Management of phoenix crowns: GRADUAL REDUCTION - DO NOT remove all poles at once. Severe shock can kill ancient tree. PHASED APPROACH - Remove some poles over several years. Gradual reduction allows tree to adjust. RETAIN SOME GROWTH - Never strip completely. Always leave some canopy for photosynthesis. AIM - Return to regular pollard cycle. Reduce pole length reduce weight maintain vitality.<br>Timing: Work during dormancy. Avoid nesting season. Dry conditions to minimize decay risk.<br>Value: Phoenix crowns on veterans are ecologically valuable. Combination of ancient deadwood and young vigorous growth. Habitat for diverse species.<br>Balance: Retain ecological value manage structural risk. Accept higher risk if targets allow. Ancient pollards are irreplaceable.<br>Cultural landscape: Historic pollards often protected. Restoration maintains traditional landscape character	none	
82	YES	Soil	Trees on shallow soils over bedrock are most vulnerable to:	Overwatering and root rot	Drought stress and windthrow from limited rooting depth	Nutrient excess	Excessive shade	1	Shallow soils restrict root depth limiting water reserves and mechanical anchorage making trees susceptible to drought during dry periods and instability during wind events	Roots cannot penetrate bedrock. Limited soil volume restricts water storage. Shallow root plate provides less leverage against overturning. Common in limestone chalk sandstone areas	Shallow soil limitations: WATER STRESS - Small soil volume holds limited water. Roots cannot access deep moisture. Drought vulnerability high. Trees wilt quickly in dry spells.<br>ANCHORAGE - Shallow root plate limited leverage. Heart-root system cannot develop. Tap roots blocked. Stability compromised especially in wind.<br>NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY - Limited soil volume restricts total nutrients. Depletion possible especially phosphorus potassium.<br>Typical scenarios: LIMESTONE PAVEMENTS - Soil in fissures only. Depth 10-50cm. Trees grow in cracks. CHALK DOWNLAND - Thin soil (20-40cm) over chalk. Free-draining exacerbates drought. ROCK OUTCROPS - Soil pockets. Depth variable and patchy.<br>Species adaptations: TOLERANT - Yew ash whitebeam beech (on chalk). Small stature shallow roots acceptable. INTOLERANT - Oaks (preferring deep soils) some species struggle. Large forest trees generally unsuitable.<br>Symptoms of problems: DROUGHT - Early leaf loss wilting small leaves reduced growth dieback. INSTABILITY - Lean development soil cracks around base rocking in wind. Root plate appears to lift.<br>Assessment considerations: Soil depth survey. Bedrock depth probe. Species selection crucial. Realistic expectations for growth and form.<br>Management: SPECIES SELECTION - Plant shallow-rooted species adapted to site. IRRIGATION - May be necessary in dry periods. REDUCE SAIL AREA - Prune to reduce wind loading if instability develops. ACCEPT LIMITATIONS - Trees will be smaller more stressed than on deep soils.<br>Engineering solutions: Rock anchors ground anchors guy wires if retention essential. Expensive rarely justified	none	
83	YES	Biomech	The purpose of reaction wood (compression wood in conifers tension wood in broadleaves) is to:	Store extra nutrients	Straighten or stabilize the stem in response to gravitational or mechanical loading	Increase timber value	Protect against insects	1	Reaction wood forms on loaded sides of stems to resist bending and pull or push the stem back toward vertical or stable position	Trees actively respond to mechanical stress. Compression wood in conifers pushes. Tension wood in broadleaves pulls. Both correct lean and prevent progressive bending	Reaction wood mechanics: CONIFERS - Compression wood forms on LOWER/COMPRESSION side of lean. Cells modified with thickened walls more lignin. PUSHES stem upward.<br>BROADLEAVES - Tension wood forms on UPPER/TENSION side of lean. Cells with gelatinous G-layer high cellulose. PULLS stem upward.<br>Identification: COMPRESSION WOOD - Darker color red-brown in some species denser and harder. Compression side of bent stem. TENSION WOOD - Often lighter lustrous appearance when fresh. Tension side of bent stem.<br>Growth ring patterns: Eccentric rings. Wider rings on reactive side. Visible evidence of mechanical stress and response.<br>Functional significance: SUCCESSFUL ADAPTATION - Presence shows tree is actively managing its structural situation. Positive indicator of vitality and response. CORRECTION OF LEAN - Over time stem straightens or stabilizes. Lean may reduce or stop progressing. BRANCH SUPPORT - All horizontal branches have reaction wood on top (tension in broadleaves compression in conifers).<br>Assessment implications: Reaction wood is GOOD SIGN not bad. Shows tree is responding. Concern only if reaction wood ABSENT on leaning tree - suggests recent movement or tree unable to respond.<br>Implications for failure: Trees with established reaction wood and stable lean are generally LOWER RISK than trees with recent lean and no reaction wood yet formed	none

Usually temporary response.<br>Assessment considerations: CAUSE - Identify what triggered epicormic response. Address underlying problem if possible. PROGNOSIS - Extensive epicormic growth after major stress may indicate tree struggling to survive. REMOVAL - Can remove epicormic shoots but doesn't address cause. May resprout.<br>Management: Address underlying stress if possible (improve drainage remove compaction protect roots). Prune competing epicormic shoots if desired but retain some photosynthetic capacity. Monitor tree health closely. On declining trees extensive epicormic growth may be last effort before death.<br>Veterans and ancient trees: Epicormic growth common and normal on pollards old trees. Part of natural retrenchment. Different from stress response in mature trees. Can be positive sign of vitality in veterans	none	
86	YES	Soil	Which drainage condition is most detrimental to tree root health?	Well-drained soil with good aeration	Waterlogged anaerobic soil lacking oxygen	Dry sandy soil	Moist loam soil	1	Waterlogged soils become anaerobic suffocating roots and promoting root rot diseases - roots require oxygen for respiration and cannot survive prolonged saturation	Most tree roots occupy top 30-60cm where oxygen is available. Waterlogging fills pore spaces with water displacing air. Roots die back. Root rot pathogens thrive. Tree declines	Waterlogging effects: ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS - Soil pores filled with water. No air spaces. Oxygen depleted within hours to days.<br>ROOT SUFFOCATION - Roots require oxygen for respiration. Cannot function without air. Fine roots die first.<br>ROOT ROT - Phytophthora Armillaria other pathogens favor waterlogged soils.

88	YES	Defect	A stem showing longitudinal splitting with bark separating from wood typically indicates:	Normal seasonal expansion	Serious internal stress or failure progressing	Recent successful pruning	Good cambial growth	1	Longitudinal splits with bark separating indicate the stem is under extreme stress and failing - internal forces are pulling the stem apart	Splits form when internal stresses exceed wood strength. May be from overloading decay progression ring shake or failure in progress. Bark separates as wood splits beneath	Causes of longitudinal splitting: OVERLOAD - Bending loads exceed stem capacity. Tension failure on loaded side. Wood splits longitudinally along grain.<br>RING SHAKE - Growth rings separate. Internal crack between annual rings. May open under load.<br>DECAY - Extensive internal decay weakens stem. Shell too thin. Cracks propagate through remaining wood.<br>FROST - Severe frost cracks can cause longitudinal splits. Usually vertical and localized.<br>Progression: INITIAL CRACK - Small split internal. May not be visible externally. PROPAGATION - Crack extends along grain under continued loading. BARK SEPARATION - External bark pulls away as split widens. Wood visible in gap. FAILURE - Complete stem failure along split line. Snap or progressive collapse.<br>Assessment urgency: Longitudinal splits are CRITICAL defects. Indicate imminent or progressive failure. URGENT assessment required. Immediate risk management.<br>Examination: Map extent of split (length depth). Check if split is through stem or partial. Test for movement (gap changes with pressure). Look for associated decay or other defects.<br>Risk factors: LOCATION - Splits on high-stress zones (mid-span branches over targets). EXTENT - Longer deeper splits more critical.

Retrenchment extends lifespan by reducing size and load. Natural and positive in veterans. Sign of successful aging	Retrenchment process: CROWN DIEBACK - Upper branches die back. Crown height reduces. Outer extremities shed.<br>LOWER REGROWTH - Dormant/epicormic buds activate on trunk and main scaffold. New shoots develop.<br>PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION - Over decades crown becomes smaller more compact. Tree shrinks but remains alive.<br>LOAD REDUCTION - Reduced crown weight wind loading. Less structural stress.<br>Why retrenchment occurs: HYDRAULIC LIMITATIONS - Aging vascular system cannot supply water to tall crown. Upper branches die. STRUCTURAL LIMITS - Crown weight exceeds safe capacity. Shedding reduces load. ENERGY BALANCE - Reduced photosynthetic area matches reduced root capacity. Equilibrium.<br>Recognition: DEAD TOPS - Stag-headed appearance. Dead branches projecting above canopy. EPICORMIC GROWTH - New shoots on lower trunk and main branches. REDUCED SIZE - Crown smaller than historical photos or expected for species/age.

Co-dominant stems with included bark	Subordinate branch with 2:1 diameter ratio and U-shaped union	Acute angle fork with narrow union	Equal-sized stems at 45 degrees	1	A subordinate branch that is significantly smaller than the main stem (2:1 ratio) with a U-shaped union and no included bark provides optimal strength	The main stem maintains dominance. U-shape indicates good wood integration. Branch is clearly secondary. Stress is distributed effectively along the union	Optimal union characteristics: DIAMETER RATIO - Dominant stem at least 2× diameter of subordinate. Clearly established hierarchy. Main stem continues upward.<br>UNION SHAPE - U-shaped wide angle (greater than 60°). Wood fibers integrated across union. No sharp angle or stress concentration.<br>BARK - Branch bark ridge on OUTSIDE of union (not included between stems). Normal bark configuration indicates proper wood connection.<br>LENGTH - Long union aspect ratio greater than 2:1. Stress distributed along length.<br>Why this configuration is strongest: LOAD DISTRIBUTION - Subordinate branch doesn't challenge main stem. Loads transferred smoothly. WOOD INTEGRATION - U-shape allows intergrowth of wood tissues. Strong structural connection. NO WEAKNESS PLANES - Absence of included bark means no slip plane. Full wood-to-wood bond. Hierarchy maintained - main stem continues growth dominance. Branch remains secondary.<br>Contrast with weak unions: CO-DOMINANT STEMS - Equal size compete for dominance. High stress at union. Often have included bark. V-SHAPE - Narrow angle concentrates stress. Union often short. Bark commonly included. POOR ASPECT RATIO - Short union on thick stems. Stress concentrated.<br>Assessment application: GOOD UNIONS - Wide U-shape subordinate branch clear bark ridge outside. LOW RISK can usually retain.

91	YES	Soil	Mycorrhizal associations benefit trees primarily by:	Fixing atmospheric nitrogen	Enhancing water and nutrient uptake especially phosphorus	Producing growth hormones	Protecting against all diseases	1	Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships with tree roots extending the effective rooting zone and increasing absorption of water and nutrients particularly phosphorus	Fungal hyphae extend far beyond root zone. Massively increase surface area for absorption. Essential partnership for most trees. Trees provide sugars to fungi. Fungi provide nutrients and water to trees	Mycorrhizal types: ECTOMYCORRHIZAE - Fungi form sheath around root tips. Hyphae penetrate between cortex cells (NOT into cells). Common with trees - oak beech birch pine spruce fir larch.<br>ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE (AM) - Fungi penetrate root cortex cells form arbuscules (branched structures). Common with maples ashes fruit trees many herbaceous plants.<br>ERICOID - Specialized type for heathers. Not relevant to most trees.<br>Benefits to trees: NUTRIENT UPTAKE - Especially phosphorus which is immobile in soil. Also nitrogen potassium micronutrients. Fungi access nutrients beyond root depletion zone. WATER UPTAKE - Hyphae extend into soil pores roots cannot reach. Improve drought tolerance. DISEASE PROTECTION - Some mycorrhizae produce antibiotics. Physical barrier effect. Enhanced tree vigor improves resistance. SOIL STRUCTURE - Fungal hyphae bind soil particles. Improve structure.<br>Benefits to fungi: CARBON - Trees provide sugars from photosynthesis. Fungi cannot photosynthesize depend on host.<br>Implications for tree management: DISTURBING SOIL - Tilling compaction construction damage mycorrhizal networks. Trees suffer. FUNGICIDES - Some fungicides harm mycorrhizae. Reduce benefits. FERTILIZATION - High phosphorus reduces mycorrhizal colonization (tree doesn't need fungi as much). Natural balance disrupted. SPECIES MATCHING - Different fungi associate with different tree species. Nurse logs and established trees help establish mycorrhizae for seedlings.<br>Recognition: Ectomycorrhizal fruiting bodies - Many familiar mushrooms (boletes amanitas). Indicate healthy mycorrhizal system.<br>Management: PROTECT SOIL - Minimize disturbance. Preserve natural litter layer. AVOID CHEMICALS - Limit fungicide use especially broad-spectrum. MULCH - Organic mulch supports fungal growth. NATURAL REGENERATION - Planting near established trees allows mycorrhizal colonization	none

Extremely dangerous situation	Root plate heave characteristics: VISIBLE SIGNS - Soil mounded or lifted on one side (usually windward/tension side). Cracks radiating from base. Turf lifted. Lean developing or increasing. Exposed roots on opposite side (compression side).<br>MECHANISM - Wind or loading causes tree to rotate. Roots on tension side pull upward lift soil. Roots on compression side compress downward.<br>PROGRESSIVE FAILURE - Each loading cycle causes more movement. Roots fail incrementally. Soil loosens. Stability decreases. Eventually catastrophic failure.<br>Assessment urgency: Root plate heave is EXTREME HAZARD. Failure imminent. Immediate exclusion zone. Urgent specialist assessment. DO NOT DELAY.<br>Investigation: Document lean angle and direction. Map extent of soil disturbance. Probe root plate for movement. Check for associated fungal decay. Compare to any historical photos/records.<br>Risk factors: RECENT STORMS - Wind-loading caused initial movement. SATURATED SOIL - Reduced soil strength. Roots fail more easily. ROOT DECAY - Armillaria Ganoderma Meripilus weaken roots. Heave occurs more readily. SHALLOW SOILS - Limited rooting depth. Poor anchorage.<br>Management: IMMEDIATE BARRIERS - Exclude people and vehicles. Cordon off fall zone. SPECIALIST ASSESSMENT - Arborist or engineer. Consider pulling test if safe to approach. REMOVAL PRIORITY - Usually required urgently. Dangerous to fell - partial failure may occur during work. RARE STABILIZATION - Guying or ground anchors sometimes used for high-value trees. Engineering input essential. Very expensive.<br>Prognosis: Trees with significant root plate heave rarely recover. Stability permanently compromised. Removal usually necessary	none

They reduce tree weight	They provide habitat for rare saproxylic invertebrates	They improve timber quality	They prevent disease	1	Deadwood in veterans supports saproxylic (deadwood-dependent) species including rare beetles fungi and other invertebrates found nowhere else	Ancient trees with deadwood cavities rot holes and decaying wood are biodiversity hotspots. Hundreds of invertebrate species depend on these features. Takes centuries to develop. Irreplaceable	Saproxylic species: BEETLES - Violet click beetle noble chafer stag beetle. Larvae develop in decaying wood for years.<br>FLIES - Hoverflies soldier flies. Many specialist deadwood species.<br>FUNGI - Wood-decay fungi. Primary decomposers. Support food chains.<br>Others - Pseudoscorpions centipedes spiders. Complex ecosystem.<br>Deadwood types in veterans: HEART ROT - Internal decay creates cavities. Vary in moisture size depth. Different species occupy different conditions. ROT HOLES - Water-filled cavities. Unique aquatic habitat in tree. DEAD BRANCHES - Standing dead wood. Bark loose. Insect galleries. WOUNDS - Exposed heartwood. Sap runs. Specialized fauna.<br>Ecological succession: Freshly dead wood - Early colonizers. Bark beetles. Partly decayed wood - Intermediate fauna. Longhorn beetles. Highly decayed wood - Late successional species. Click beetles. Each stage supports different species.<br>Conservation importance: UK BAP priority species depend on veterans. European protected species. Irreplaceable habitat - Takes 200-400+ years to develop equivalent deadwood features. Loss of ancient trees equals loss of dependent species.<br>Management implications: RETAIN DEADWOOD - Do NOT remove dead branches cavities rot unless safety critical. MINIMIZE INTERVENTION - Accept higher risk if targets allow. Deadwood is habitat not defect. VETERANS SPECIAL STATUS - Protected by policy. Ecological value outweighs amenity/safety in many contexts. CAREFUL REDUCTION - If work necessary minimize deadwood removal. Retain as much as safely possible.<br>Legal protection: Ancient trees often protected. Removal requires exceptional justification.

Often coppiced. Common in hedgerows and woodland edges.<br>CATKINS - Male catkins (lambs tails) present in winter. Long pendulous yellow. Visible from December onward. Distinctive.<br>Diagnostic features: DOWNY BUDS - Hairy covering visible with close inspection. Rounded shape. ZIGZAG TWIGS - Distinctive pattern. CATKINS - If present unmistakable. Long yellow structures hanging from twigs.<br>Additional clues: Hazelnuts - Often found on ground below trees or in squirrel caches. Distinctive. Coppice form - Frequently coppiced historically for fencing hurdles. Multiple stems from base.<br>Confusion species: Alder - Smooth buds (not hairy) dark purple buds cones often present. Birch - Smooth bark white or silver buds not downy different twig pattern.<br>Field ID: Small DOWNY ROUNDED BUDS on ZIGZAG TWIGS equals Hazel. Male CATKINS in winter clinch identification.<br>Management note: Hazel benefits from coppicing. Cut to ground level every 7-15 years. Produces straight poles. Traditional woodland management.<br>Wildlife value: Nuts for mammals. Catkins early pollen source for insects. Dense cover for birds	none	
96	YES	Defect	A basal cavity with extensive decay but adequate shell thickness (t/R greater than 0.3) indicates:	Immediate failure risk requiring removal	Tree may be structurally adequate - assess shell uniformity and loading	Excellent structural condition	Decay has stopped completely	1	Shell thickness ratio is critical - adequate shell can maintain strength despite central cavity if uniform and without openings	The outer shell carries most bending load. If shell is thick enough continuous and sound the tree can remain stable for decades despite large central cavity	Shell thickness assessment: CRITICAL RATIO t/R - Shell thickness (t) divided by radius (R). Greater than 0.3 generally adequate. 0.2-0.3 marginal requires detailed analysis. Less than 0.2 concerning high risk.<br>MEASUREMENT - Use increment borer resistograph or tomography. Measure at multiple radii to check uniformity. Calculate t/R at narrowest point.<br>UNIFORMITY - Shell must be continuous around circumference. No large openings or cracks. Asymmetric decay more concerning than symmetric.<br>Engineering principle: Hollow tube strong in bending if walls adequate. Stress concentrated at outer fibers - center contributes little. Removing center (decay) has less impact than expected if shell remains.<br>Complications reducing safety: OPENINGS - Wounds or cavities through shell. Stress concentration at opening edges. Each opening weakens structure significantly. CRACKS - Longitudinal splits in shell. Propagate under load. Critical defect. ASYMMETRY - One side thinner than other. Weak point determines capacity. MULTIPLE DEFECTS - Shell decay plus root decay plus lean etc. Combined effects.<br>Assessment protocol: Measure shell thickness multiple locations. Calculate t/R ratio. Check for openings cracks asymmetry. Consider loading (wind exposure crown size). Evaluate consequences (targets). Combine factors for overall risk rating.<br>Management options: ADEQUATE SHELL - Monitor periodically. Re-measure shell thickness every 3-5 years. Retain if safe. MARGINAL SHELL - Reduce loading (crown reduction). Increase monitoring frequency. Consider targets. INADEQUATE SHELL - Usually requires removal. May consider drastic reduction if high value. Risk varies with species loading site.<br>Veteran tree note: Many ancient oaks have t/R less than 0.3 but survive due to adaptive growth low height reduced crown. Apply veteran tree principles - accept higher risk if targets allow	none	
97	YES	Pest	Oak Processionary Moth caterpillars are a concern because they:	Improve oak health	Have urticating hairs causing health risks to humans and animals	Only affect dead trees	Prevent other pests	1	OPM caterpillars have thousands of toxic hairs that cause severe allergic reactions skin rashes breathing problems and eye irritation in humans and animals	The hairs remain potent for years even after caterpillars pupate. Nests contain thousands of shed hairs. Significant public health hazard. Notifiable pest in UK - must report	Oak Processionary Moth (Thaumetopoea processionea): DESCRIPTION - Caterpillars up to 5cm long grey-black with very long white hairs. Form conspicuous white silken nests on trunks and branches. Processionary behavior - move nose-to-tail in lines.<br>HAZARD - Urticating setae (hairs) contain thaumetopoein toxin. 60000+ hairs per caterpillar. Cause severe itching rashes breathing difficulties eye problems. Veterinary concern for pets livestock.<br>TREE DAMAGE - Defoliate oaks. Repeated defoliation weakens trees. Can kill young oaks. Mature oaks usually survive but stressed.<br>LIFECYCLE - Eggs laid July-August overwinter. Larvae hatch March-April. Feed April-June. Most visible May-June. Pupate June-July in nests. Adults fly July-August.<br>DISTRIBUTION UK - Established in London and surrounding areas. Spreading slowly. Subject to eradication attempts. Notifiable - DEFRA must be informed of sightings.<br>Management: DO NOT TOUCH - Never approach nests or caterpillars. Professional treatment only. CONTROL - Pesticide spray (Bacillus thuringiensis) in April-May. Nest removal by specialists using protective equipment. Pheromone traps for adults. PUBLIC AWARENESS - Signage in affected areas. Keep people and animals away.<br>Health effects: SKIN - Itching burning rash welts. Can last weeks. RESPIRATORY - Breathing difficulties bronchitis asthma exacerbation. EYES - Conjunctivitis irritation. SYSTEMIC - Dizziness nausea fever in severe cases.<br>Legal status: Notifiable pest under Plant Health legislation. Landowners have legal duty to report and control. Failure to report is offense	none	
98	YES	Defect	Co-dominant stems with bark inclusion are most likely to fail:	Never - bark provides cushioning	At the union where included bark creates a slip plane	Only during summer	At the root plate	1	Included bark prevents wood-to-wood connection creating a plane of weakness where stems can split apart under loading	The bark acts as a wedge forcing stems apart. No structural connection exists - only friction and compression. Load causes stems to separate along bark plane	Included bark union mechanics: FORMATION - Two stems compete for dominance. Grow at narrow angle. Bark becomes trapped between stems as they expand. NO FUSION - Wood cannot grow across bark barrier. Stems remain separate.<br>WEAKNESS PLANE - Bark provides no tensile strength. Acts as slip surface. Only friction resists separation.<br>STRESS CONCENTRATION - Narrow angle focuses stress at union. High forces attempting to split stems apart.<br>Loading scenarios: ASYMMETRIC LOADING - Wind from one side. One stem loaded more heavily. Tries to peel away from union. WEIGHT - Heavy foliage ice snow on co-dominant stems. Downward force tries to spread stems apart. MOVEMENT - Stems flex independently in wind. Differential movement progressively works union apart.<br>Failure progression: INITIAL MICRO-MOVEMENT - Small movements with each wind event. Bark compressed. Slight opening of union. CRACK INITIATION - Stress exceeds friction. Small crack forms at top or bottom of union. PROPAGATION - Crack extends along bark plane with continued loading. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE - Crack extends full length of union. One or both stems fail suddenly.<br>Warning signs: CRACKS visible at union (top or bottom). Bark ridge extending INTO union (V-shape). Seepage or moisture at union. Movement visible or audible in wind. Recent crack propagation (fresh wood exposed).<br>Risk factors increasing failure likelihood: LONG STEMS above union - high leverage. HEAVY CROWN on one or both stems - asymmetric loading. EXPOSED SITE - high wind loading. NARROW ANGLE - acute V-shape concentrates stress. ADVANCED AGE/SIZE - larger heavier stems more difficult for union to support.<br>Assessment: Probe union with thin blade - deep penetration indicates extensive bark inclusion. Measure stem diameters - approaching 1:1 more concerning. Check for movement cracks. Consider age size exposure loading.<br>Management: YOUNG TREES - Remove one stem entirely. Establish single leader. MATURE TREES - Reduce subordinate stem if possible. Install support cable ABOVE union (doesn't fix weakness but limits movement). Monitor closely for crack propagation. HAZARDOUS UNIONS - Removal often necessary if high-value targets below. Failure sudden and unpredictable	none	
99	YES	Disease	Ash dieback (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus) typically causes:	Improved ash timber quality	Progressive crown dieback starting with shoot wilting and dark lesions on stems	Root strengthening	Increased growth rate	1	Ash dieback causes progressive dieback from crown downward with characteristic diamond-shaped lesions on bark and wilting blackened shoots	Devastating disease killing ash across Europe and UK. No cure. Most ash will die or be severely compromised. Changes UK landscape fundamentally	Ash dieback (Chalara - Hymenoscyphus fraxineus): SYMPTOMS - Wilting and blackening of shoots and leaves. Crown dieback progressive from top downward. Diamond-shaped dark lesions on bark (necrotic patches). Epicormic growth on stem and branches (compensation attempt). Progressive death over 2-10 years typically.<br>PATHOGEN - Fungus originates from Asia. Arrived UK circa 2012. Spores spread by wind over long distances. Infects through leaves in summer.<br>DISEASE PROGRESSION - Initial infection in leaves and shoots. Spreads to branches and stem. Lesions girdle branches cause dieback. Repeated annual infection. Crown progressively dies back. Secondary pathogens (Armillaria honey fungus) often colonize weakened trees causing death.<br>IMPACT UK - Estimates suggest 70-90% of UK ash will be killed or severely affected. 126 million ash trees at risk. Landscape-scale change.<br>Species affected: Fraxinus excelsior (common ash) highly susceptible. Some individual trees show tolerance/resistance (genetic variation). Younger trees often die faster. Mature trees may linger for years.<br>Management challenges: NO CURE - Cannot treat infected trees. NO PREVENTION - Cannot protect trees from infection. SAFETY RISK - Dead and dying ash become hazardous. Extensive management required. Prioritize high-risk locations. ECOLOGICAL IMPACT - Ash supports 1000+ species. Loss affects biodiversity. Landscape character changes.<br>Policy response: Remove ash from high-risk locations (near roads buildings). Retain in low-risk areas (woodlands away from infrastructure). Monitor for tolerant individuals (potential genetic resource). Biosecurity - avoid moving ash wood/material during growing season.<br>Secondary issues: Ash weakened by dieback susceptible to Armillaria (honey fungus). Combination often fatal. Brittle failure - dead ash branches fail suddenly. High hazard.<br>Identification: Diamond lesions on bark DIAGNOSTIC. Crown dieback pattern. Epicormic shoots (tree's attempt to compensate). Occurs on ash species only.<br>Future: Some genetic resistance exists. Research ongoing. May take decades for resistant populations to establish. Ash will persist but at much lower density	none	
100	YES	Defect	A stem with spiral grain and a corresponding spiral crack is concerning because:	Spiral grain is always stronger	Cracks following grain spiral around stem reducing effective shell thickness on all sides	Spiral patterns indicate health	This only affects appearance	1	Spiral cracks follow the spiral grain around the stem potentially compromising structural integrity on multiple aspects rather than just one side	Normal longitudinal cracks affect one side. Spiral cracks wrap around reducing effective shell thickness progressively. Much more dangerous configuration	Spiral characteristics: SPIRAL GRAIN - Wood fibers oriented at angle to stem axis rather than vertical. Genetic trait in some trees. Can result from reaction to torsional loading.<br>SPIRAL CRACK - Follows spiral grain pattern. Wraps around stem like stripe on barber pole. May complete multiple turns up stem.<br>Why spiral cracks are worse: REDUCES SHELL CIRCUMFERENTIALLY - Normal vertical crack affects one side. Spiral crack affects ALL sides as it wraps. Net effect is reduced shell thickness around entire circumference. PROPAGATION PATH - Crack follows grain continuously. No natural barrier to propagation. Can extend for meters. TORSIONAL WEAKNESS - Spiral configuration reduces torsional strength. Stem can twist more easily along crack. MULTIPLE FAILURE MODES - Can fail in bending OR torsion. Crack provides path for both.<br>Assessment complexity: DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE - Cannot easily measure shell thickness because crack is not localized. HIDDEN EXTENT - Crack may continue behind bark. Full extent difficult to determine. PROGRESSIVE - Likely to propagate further with continued loading.<br>Detection: VISUAL - Spiral crack visible on bark surface. May be subtle - look carefully. BARK PATTERN - Spiral bark ridges or fissures may indicate spiral grain beneath (even without crack). SPECIES - Some species prone to spiral grain (sweet chestnut). HISTORY - Lightning strikes can cause spiral cracks. Common pattern.<br>Risk factors: LONG CRACK - Greater extent equals more structural compromise. DEEP CRACK - Penetrates deeply into wood. MOVEMENT - Gap opens and closes with wind. Active propagation. LOADING - High wind exposure heavy crown.<br>Management: SPIRAL CRACKS are HIGH RISK. Difficult to assess accurately. Conservative approach warranted. Options: Detailed inspection (climbing if necessary). Probe crack depth. Resistograph or tomography if high value. Consider removal if over high-value targets. Load reduction (crown reduction) may extend safe life. Monitor very closely if retained.<br>Species note: Sweet chestnut commonly has spiral grain and spiral cracks. Assess each individually. Not automatically hazardous but requires careful evaluation	none	
101	YES	Pest	Horse Chestnut Leaf Miner (Cameraria ohridella) causes:	Improved photosynthesis	Premature browning and leaf drop reducing tree vigor	Enhanced flowering	Stronger wood	1	Leaf miner larvae create mines within leaves causing brown blotches and early leaf drop - reduces photosynthesis and weakens trees over time	Larvae feed between leaf surfaces creating mines. Heavy infestation causes leaves to brown by mid-summer. Trees produce second flush but weakened. Repeated annual attack reduces vigor	Horse Chestnut Leaf Miner: DESCRIPTION - Tiny moth 3-5mm wingspan. Larvae mine within leaves.<br>SYMPTOMS - Serpentine mines initially. Coalesce into brown blotches. Leaves look scorched by mid-summer. Premature leaf drop often by July-August.<br>LIFECYCLE - Multiple generations per year (3-4). Overwinters as pupae in leaf litter. Adults emerge April. Eggs laid on leaves. Larvae mine through summer. Population peaks by late summer.<br>SPREAD - Arrived UK 2002. Now widespread across England and Wales. Spreading northward. Highly mobile - adults disperse readily.<br>IMPACT ON TREES - Reduces photosynthesis. Aesthetic damage (brown unsightly leaves). Weakens tree over years of repeated attack. Can predispose to other problems. Generally not fatal but significant stress.<br>ECOLOGICAL - Horse chestnut primary host. Aesculus hippocastanum most affected. Other Aesculus species also susceptible. Native range in Balkans - coevolved with host.<br>Management challenges: NO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT for large trees. Insecticides impractical and environmentally undesirable. Biological control research ongoing. Blue tits and other birds predate larvae - encourage birds. LEAF LITTER REMOVAL - Removing fallen leaves destroys overwintering pupae. Reduces next year's population. Labor intensive. Practical for small trees only. COMPOSTING - Ensure composting process heats sufficiently to kill pupae. Otherwise spread in compost.<br>Urban forestry implications: Reduced amenity value - brown trees by mid-summer unsightly. May influence species selection for new planting. Consider alternative species. Some horse chestnuts show tolerance - individual variation.<br>Prognosis: Permanent established pest. Horse chestnut landscape character changed. Trees persist but under chronic stress. Long-term impacts unclear - decades of attack may cause cumulative decline.<br>Combined stresses: Leaf miner plus other factors (drought poor soils Guignardia leaf blotch bleeding canker) can be serious. Stressed trees less able to cope with multiple issues.<br>Not a notifiable pest - no legal control requirements. Monitoring and adaptive management	none	
102	YES	Biomech	The term 'hinge' in a weak union refers to:	A metal connector	The point where stems can rotate relative to each other due to lack of structural connection	A pruning technique	Root junction	1	A hinge forms when two stems have minimal connection and can pivot relative to each other - characteristic of unions with extensive included bark	The union acts like a hinge joint rather than rigid connection. Stems can flex independently. Movement progressively worsens weakness. Leads to failure	Hinge union mechanics: MINIMAL CONNECTION - Little or no wood-to-wood bond. Bark inclusion extensive. Stems held only by compression and friction.<br>PIVOT POINT - Union acts as fulcrum. Stems can rotate relative to each other. Movement visible or palpable in wind.<br>DIFFERENTIAL FLEXING - Each stem responds independently to loading. One bends one way other bends differently. Movement works union apart.<br>Progressive failure mechanism: MICRO-MOVEMENT - Small relative motion with each wind event. Bark compresses and rebounds. Slight wear at interface. CRACK INITIATION - Repeated movement fatigues wood at union edges. Crack forms at stress concentration (usually top or bottom of union). PROPAGATION - Crack extends along bark plane. Hinge action continues to work crack deeper. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE - Crack extends full length of union. One stem fails suddenly. Often with loud crack or tearing sound.<br>Detection of hinge unions: VISUAL INSPECTION - Look for movement in moderate wind. Stems flex independently. Gap opening and closing at union top or bottom. PHYSICAL TEST - Push on stems (if safe to approach). Feel for independent movement. Pivot action. SOUND - Sometimes audible creaking or groaning as stems move. Indicates active hinge. CRACKS - Visible cracks at union edges. Fresh wood exposed indicates recent propagation.<br>Risk factors: LARGE STEMS - Heavier greater momentum more force on union. HIGH WIND EXPOSURE - Frequent loading cycles accelerate failure. ASYMMETRIC CROWNS - One stem heavier loads union unevenly. AGE - Older unions more likely to have developed cracks.<br>Management urgency: ACTIVE HINGE UNIONS are EXTREME HAZARD. Movement proves weakness. Failure likely imminent or in progress. IMMEDIATE ACTION required. Options: Emergency removal (safest). Temporary support (propping) to stabilize during removal if necessary. Do NOT cable - doesn't address hinge weakness and may increase loading. Consider exclusion zones during work - failure can occur during removal operations.<br>Contrast with solid unions: SOLID UNION - No independent movement. Wood fully integrated. Acts as single rigid structure. HINGE UNION - Independent movement. Stems pivot on each other. Acts as articulated joint. Assess by testing for movement	none	
103	YES	Disease	Phytophthora root rot is most commonly associated with:	Dry sandy soils	Poorly drained waterlogged soils	Well-aerated loamy soils	Frozen ground	1	Phytophthora species are water molds that thrive in waterlogged anaerobic soils and cause root and collar rot	Phytophthora means 'plant destroyer' - these oomycetes (not true fungi) require water for spread and infection. Waterlogging creates ideal conditions for infection and spread	Phytophthora diseases: PATHOGEN TYPE - Oomycetes not true fungi. Related to algae. Produce motile zoospores that swim in water films.<br>SPECIES - Multiple Phytophthora species affect trees. P. cinnamomi P. ramorum P. cambivora P. alni complex others.<br>HOST RANGE - Very broad. Affects oaks alders beech many other species. Different species have different hosts.<br>SYMPTOMS - Crown thinning dieback. Bleeding cankers at base (tarry reddish exudate). Root rot black discolored roots. Collar rot at ground level. Tree decline and death.<br>SPREAD - Water movement (soil water surface runoff irrigation). Contaminated soil tools plants. Zoospores swim to roots.<br>Favorable conditions: WATERLOGGING - Saturated soils. Oxygen depleted. Roots stressed and vulnerable. Zoospores mobile in water. POOR DRAINAGE - Clay soils compacted soils sites with high water table. WARM TEMPERATURES - Most species favor 15-25°C. Some active in cooler conditions. SUSCEPTIBLE HOSTS - Stressed trees more vulnerable. Root damage construction disturbance.<br>Species-specific examples: P. RAMORUM - Causes sudden oak death (USA) and ramorum blight (UK). Affects many species. Notifiable disease. P. ALNI - Alder Phytophthora. Devastating to alders near water. Notifiable. P. CINNAMOMI - Root rot pathogen. Very broad host range. Warm climate species. P. CAMBIVORA - Affects beech oak sweet chestnut. Bleeding cankers.<br>Management: IMPROVE DRAINAGE - Critical. Remove standing water. Install drains. Avoid overwatering. AVOID SPREAD - Clean tools and equipment. Don't move soil or plants from infected areas. Biosecurity protocols. SPECIES SELECTION - Plant appropriate species for wet sites. Avoid susceptible species on poor drainage. REMOVE INFECTED MATERIAL - Remove and destroy affected trees. Don't compost or chip infected material (spreads disease). CHEMICAL CONTROL - Phosphite injections can boost tree defenses. Not curative but may slow progression. Expensive. Practical for high-value specimens only.<br>Legal status: Some Phytophthora species are notifiable diseases. P. ramorum P. lateralis P. kernoviae must be reported to authorities. Failure to report is offense.<br>Long-term impacts: No cure. Once established in soil persists indefinitely. Produces resistant spores that survive for years. Site remains high-risk. Consider area unsuitable for susceptible species.<br>Climate change: Warming temperatures favor Phytophthora spread. Extreme rainfall events increase waterlogging. Emerging diseases expected to worsen	none	
104	YES	Defect	Seams or longitudinal cracks with old callus tissue and no recent extension indicate:	Active progressive failure	Historic injury that has been compartmentalized and is stable	Immediate removal required	Recent storm damage	1	Old callus formation shows tree successfully walled off the injury years ago - if no recent extension the crack is stable and compartmentalized	Tree's CODIT response created barriers around wound. Callus tissue (wound wood) rolls over crack edges attempting closure. If stable for years unlikely to propagate further	Crack assessment - historic vs active: HISTORIC STABLE CRACKS - Callus tissue well-developed rolled edges. Bark healed over much of crack. No fresh wood exposed. Crack width unchanged over time. Tree adapted to presence.<br>ACTIVE PROGRESSIVE CRACKS - Fresh wood visible. Crack extending (compare to previous inspections or photos). Callus tissue minimal or absent. Bark separating at edges. Gap width changing with loading.<br>Callus tissue formation: WOUND RESPONSE - Cambium at wound edge produces wound wood (callus). Rolls over injury progressively. Attempts to close wound. RATE - Slow process. Takes years to decades. Fast-growing vigorous trees callus faster. APPEARANCE - Distinctive rounded bulging tissue at wound margins. Often lighter colored when fresh. FUNCTION - Compartmentalizes injury. Prevents spread of decay. Restores some structural continuity.<br>Assessment protocol: DOCUMENT - Photograph crack. Measure length width. Note callus development. COMPARE - Review previous inspection records photos. Has crack extended? Callus increased? PROBE - Check for decay behind callus. Soft punky wood indicates active decay. Sound wood indicates successful compartmentalization. CALCULATE - Estimate percentage of cross-section affected. Consider shell thickness if central decay present. LOADING - Assess crown size wind exposure. Forces acting on stem.<br>Risk evaluation: OLD STABLE CRACK with good callus and no decay - LOWER RISK. Monitor periodically (every 3-5 years). Measure to confirm no extension. ADEQUATE SHELL remaining - If crack reduces shell but t/R still greater than 0.3 may be acceptable. COMPENSATORY GROWTH - Look for adaptive thickening near crack. Tree reinforcing weak area. LOADING - Consider if loading has changed (adjacent trees removed crown grown).<br>Management: STABLE CRACKS - Usually retain and monitor. Regular inspection to confirm no progression. Photo documentation for comparison. ACTIVE CRACKS - Assess urgently. Determine cause. Consider load reduction or removal. NO INTERVENTION on old stable cracks - Don't disturb callus. Don't fill or seal. Allow natural process.<br>Tree biology: Trees cannot 'heal' wounds like animals. They compartmentalize - wall off injured tissue and continue growing around it. Successful compartmentalization means injury managed. Long-term stability achieved	none	
105	YES	Pest	The Asian Longhorn Beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis) is a serious concern because:	It improves timber quality	It attacks many hardwood species and can kill healthy trees	It only affects dead wood	It prevents other pests	1	ALB larvae bore deep into wood creating extensive galleries that weaken and kill even healthy mature trees - devastating pest of many hardwood species	Beetle is not established in UK but present in Europe. Notifiable quarantine pest. Would be catastrophic if established. Attacks and kills healthy trees	Asian Longhorn Beetle: DESCRIPTION - Large beetle 20-40mm long. Glossy black with white spots. Very long antennae (longer than body) with black and white bands. Larvae white 50mm long bore in wood.<br>HOSTS - Very wide host range. Maples (Acer) birch willow poplar horse chestnut elm ash many others. Healthy trees attacked - doesn't require stressed hosts.<br>DAMAGE - Adults chew bark and twigs. Larvae bore deep into wood (heartwood and sapwood). Extensive galleries weaken structure. Disrupts vascular tissue. Trees decline and die typically 2-5 years.<br>SIGNS - Round exit holes 10-15mm diameter. Coarse frass (sawdust) expelled from holes and at base. Sap weeping from oviposition sites. Crown dieback.<br>LIFECYCLE - Eggs laid in bark pits. Larvae bore inward. Feed 1-2 years inside wood. Pupate in wood. Adults emerge through round exit holes May-October. Adults live several months.<br>SPREAD - Natural dispersal limited (adults fly up to 2km). Long-distance spread via infested wood products and packaging. International trade pathway.<br>UK STATUS - Not currently established in UK. Occasional interceptions. Several outbreaks in Europe (now eradicated or under containment). High priority quarantine pest. Extensive surveillance.<br>IMPACT IF ESTABLISHED - Could devastate UK hardwood trees. Urban trees street trees woodlands all at risk. No native natural enemies. Control very difficult once established.<br>Management if found: NOTIFY IMMEDIATELY - Legal requirement. Contact APHA (Animal and Plant Health Agency). DO NOT MOVE WOOD - Quarantine essential. Can spread in firewood and wood products. ERADICATION PROTOCOL - Remove and destroy infested trees including stumps. Survey surrounding area extensively. Establish quarantine zone.<br>International examples: NORTH AMERICA - Established in several cities. Eradication programs cost hundreds of millions. Tree removal extensive. EUROPE - Outbreaks in several countries. Intensive eradication efforts ongoing.<br>Prevention: BIOSECURITY - Inspect wood packaging from Asia. Don't import firewood from abroad. Report sightings immediately. PUBLIC AWARENESS - Recognize signs. Know how to report.<br>Comparison to native longhorns: Native longhorns (Cerambycidae) usually attack dead stressed or dying trees. Asian longhorn attacks healthy trees. Much more aggressive and dangerous	none	
106	YES	Biomech	A tree with significant root buttressing on one side suggests:	Random growth pattern	Directional loading and adaptive growth response	Disease	Recent planting	1	Asymmetric buttressing develops where loading is directional - tree adds wood where stress is highest to resist overturning forces	Trees optimize structure through adaptive growth. Buttressing on loaded side resists tension (pulling) and provides mechanical stability. Evidence of successful adaptation	Directional loading and response: LOADING SOURCES - Prevailing wind (constant directional force). Slope (gravitational component). Lean (tree compensating for off-center mass). Adjacent structures (buildings forcing directional growth).<br>ADAPTIVE RESPONSE - Tree detects stress patterns. Adds wood where stress is highest (Axiom of Uniform Stress). Buttressing develops on loaded side. Eccentric growth rings.<br>ROOT ARCHITECTURE - Extensive root development on tension side (resists uplift). Compression roots on opposite side (resists sliding/compression). Asymmetric root plate is NORMAL on slopes or exposed sites.<br>Assessment implications: BUTTRESSING INDICATES ADAPTATION - Tree has responded to its mechanical environment. This is POSITIVE sign shows tree managing its structural situation. STABLE LONG-TERM LOADING - Buttressing takes years to develop. Indicates loading pattern is long-standing not recent. Tree has adapted over time. DIRECTION OF CONCERN - Maximum stress is opposite the buttressing. If tree fails likely toward direction of lean/wind. Plan management accordingly.<br>Contrast with symmetric buttressing: SYMMETRIC - Radial buttressing around circumference. Indicates balanced loading from multiple directions or no dominant direction. Typical of open-grown trees protected sites. ASYMMETRIC - Pronounced buttressing on one or two sides. Indicates directional loading. Typical of sloped sites exposed sites trees near structures.<br>Risk evaluation: BUTTRESSING PRESENT with stable lean/position - LOWER RISK. Tree adapted and managing loads. BUTTRESSING ABSENT on leaning tree - HIGHER RISK. Suggests recent movement or tree unable to respond. Decline indicated. BUTTRESS DAMAGE - Excavation construction root severance. Removes key stabilizing element. Risk increases significantly.<br>Species variation: Some species develop pronounced buttresses naturally - Beech especially on shallow soils Fagus characteristic. Others less obvious but still present.<br>Management considerations: PROTECT BUTTRESS ROOTS - Critical for stability. No excavation no grade changes. Maintain root zone integrity. RECOGNIZE ADAPTATION - Don't assume asymmetry equals problem. May be successful long-term adaptation. LOADING CHANGES - If buttressing present but loading changes (adjacent trees removed) re-evaluate. Tree optimized for previous conditions.<br>Assessment on slopes: Downhill buttressing larger - resists tension and overturning. Uphill buttressing smaller or absent - compression side. This is NORMAL and EXPECTED. Not a defect	none	
107	YES	Disease	Bacterial wetwood (slime flux) is characterized by:	Dry brittle wood	Foul-smelling watery or slimy flux oozing from wounds	Improved structural strength	Enhanced growth rate	1	Bacterial wetwood causes fermentation inside wood producing gas pressure and foul-smelling liquid that oozes from cracks and wounds	Bacteria ferment sugars producing acids gas and pressure. Flux seeps from wounds cracks bark cracks. Distinctive sour smell. Darkly stained wood internally	Bacterial wetwood/slime flux: CAUSE - Various anaerobic bacteria colonize heartwood and sapwood. Enterobacter Clostridium others.<br>PROCESS - Bacteria ferment wood contents. Produce acetic acid butyric acid methane carbon dioxide. Gas pressure builds up. Fluid forced out through openings.<br>SYMPTOMS - Seepage from wounds bark cracks branch stubs. Flux initially watery becoming slimy. Foul odor (fermenting sour smell). Staining on bark below seepage (dark grey brown). Internal wood dark wet soggy discolored. Gas pressure (fizzing hissing when bored).<br>SPECIES AFFECTED - Many hardwoods. Elm poplar willow cottonwood oak maple birch others. Common and widespread.<br>TREE IMPACTS - Weakens wood (reduced strength). Internal discoloration and staining. Can kill cambium where flux contacts bark (toxic metabolites). Usually not fatal to tree but chronic condition. Reduces timber value.<br>SECONDARY EFFECTS - Flux attracts insects (flies bees wasps). Can transmit diseases (oak wilt Dutch elm disease). Provides entry for decay fungi. Bark around seepage may die back.<br>Diagnosis: SMELL - Distinctive sour fermenting odor. APPEARANCE - Wet darkly stained seepage. INTERNAL - Dark wet wood when bored or cored. Distinct from decay (not soft crumbly). GAS - Pressure evident when drilling.<br>Management: NO CURE - Cannot eliminate bacteria once established. Chronic condition. DRAINAGE - Install drain tube to relieve pressure (controversial - may introduce decay). Often not recommended now. WOUND CARE - Clean affected bark. Allow to dry. Don't seal - prevents drying. ACCEPT - Usually best to accept condition. Tree may live for years despite wetwood. Monitor for structural weakness. AVOID WOUNDING - Minimize additional injuries that provide seepage points.<br>Prognosis: Trees can survive for decades with wetwood. Causes chronic stress but often not fatal. Reduced structural strength - factor into risk assessment. Monitor affected areas.<br>Contrast with decay: WETWOOD - Wet soggy dark but NOT soft. Wood structure intact. Caused by bacteria. DECAY - Soft crumbly or fibrous. Wood structure breaking down. Caused by fungi. Can occur together - wetwood can predispose to decay	none	
108	YES	Defect	A branch union showing 'ram's horn' configuration (tight upward curving union) typically indicates:	Excellent structural strength	Weak attachment with high failure risk	Recent rapid growth	Root problems	1	Ram's horn unions have wood fibers that curve sharply upward creating weak grain orientation and stress concentration at the union base	The tight curve creates weak grain pattern. Wood fibers oriented poorly for load transfer. Stress concentrates at base of curve. Common failure point	Ram's horn union characteristics: APPEARANCE - Branch curves sharply upward immediately from trunk. Tight radius creates horn-like shape. Narrow attachment point.<br>WEAK GRAIN - Wood fibers curve sharply following branch shape. Grain orientation perpendicular to main stress direction. Poor mechanical efficiency.<br>STRESS CONCENTRATION - Tight curve creates stress concentration at base. Maximum bending moment occurs at smallest cross-section. High risk of failure.<br>COMMON IN - Branches that were suppressed then released. Grew upward rapidly seeking light. Species with flexible wood (willow poplar).<br>Formation mechanism: SUPPRESSION - Branch shaded by upper crown or adjacent trees. Grows horizontally or downward. RELEASE - Shading removed (upper limbs die adjacent tree removed). Branch curves sharply upward toward light. RAPID GROWTH - New growth forms tight upward curve. Creates ram's horn shape.<br>Structural problems: SHORT MOMENT ARM - Union attachment is small. Leverage is high. Branch weight creates large moment at small junction. GRAIN SHEAR - Stress perpendicular to grain. Wood weak in this direction. Splitting likely. BARK INCLUSION - Sometimes develops in tight union. Further weakens attachment.<br>Failure mode: Branch typically fails at base of curve. Tears away from trunk. May take significant bark/wood from trunk. Sudden failure - little warning.<br>Risk factors: LARGE BRANCH - Heavy. High leverage on weak union. HORIZONTAL EXTENSION - Long branch increases moment arm. LOADING - Snow ice wind. Increases forces on weak union. SPECIES - Brittle wood species (willow poplar) higher risk.<br>Assessment: Visual recognition of ram's horn shape. Probe union for cracks movement. Check for included bark. Consider branch size loading exposure. Estimate failure probability.<br>Management: YOUNG TREES - Remove or reduce ram's horn branches early. Prevent development. MATURE TREES - Reduce branch weight and length. Lessens loading on weak union. May extend safe life. REMOVAL - Often necessary if over targets. Weak union difficult to mitigate. MONITORING - If retained inspect frequently for crack development.<br>Prevention: Pruning to maintain balanced crown. Prevent suppression and release cycles. Structural pruning in youth	none	
109	YES	Pest	Which sign indicates active wood-boring beetle infestation?	Old exit holes with weathered edges	Fresh bore dust (frass) and new exit holes with sharp edges	Lichen growth	Moss on bark	1	Fresh frass and new holes with clean sharp edges indicate beetles are currently active - old inactive holes are weathered and lack fresh material	Active infestations produce sawdust (frass) as larvae bore galleries. New adult emergence holes are clean and sharp-edged. Old holes weather and darken over years	Wood-boring beetle assessment: ACTIVE INFESTATION SIGNS - Fresh frass on bark or at tree base. Sawdust-like or pellet-like depending on species. New exit holes clean sharp edges fresh wood color inside. Sap bleeding from holes or oviposition sites. Bark loose easily removed galleries visible under bark. Adults present (seasonal - usually summer).<br>INACTIVE OLD INFESTATION - Holes weathered edges darkened. No frass production. Bark tight if still present. Galleries packed or empty. No adult emergence.<br>FRASS CHARACTERISTICS - Color indicates wood type (sapwood frass pale heartwood frass darker). Texture varies by beetle family (fine powder coarse fibrous pellets). Amount indicates intensity of infestation.<br>Common wood-boring beetles UK: LONGHORN BEETLES (Cerambycidae) - Larvae bore deep galleries in wood. Exit holes oval 3-10mm depending on species. Usually attack dead dying or stressed trees. JEWEL BEETLES (Buprestidae) - Flattened larvae bore under bark and into sapwood. D-shaped or oval exit holes. Often attack stressed trees. BARK BEETLES (Scolytidae) - Small beetles 2-6mm. Gallery patterns under bark distinctive (species-specific). Attack stressed trees. Some transmit diseases (Dutch elm disease). WEEVILS (Curculionidae) - Some species bore in wood. Small round exit holes. Ash dieback creates conditions favoring ash bark beetle - secondary issue.<br>Detection methods: VISUAL INSPECTION - Look for frass accumulation holes bark condition. TAP TEST - Tap bark - sounds hollow if galleries present bark detaches easily. PHEROMONE TRAPS - Some species monitored with traps. EXPERT IDENTIFICATION - Species ID often requires specialist. Gallery patterns frass characteristics adult specimens.<br>Management: STRESSED TREES MORE VULNERABLE - Vigorous trees more resistant. Maintain tree health. REMOVE INFESTED MATERIAL - If high-value specimen consider removing infested branches. Destroy material (burn or chip). ACCEPT IN WOODLAND - Natural part of ecosystem. Provides deadwood habitat. Usually don't intervene. MONITOR IN AMENITY TREES - Track progression. Some infestations localized others spread. May require removal if structural integrity compromised.<br>Structural implications: Galleries reduce wood strength. Extensive boring can significantly weaken branches or stems. Assess load-bearing capacity. Consider failure risk if infestation severe.<br>Ecological role: Wood-boring beetles are key saproxylic species. Essential for deadwood recycling. Larvae may develop for years in dead wood. Adults are food source for birds and other predators. Ancient/veteran trees - galleries and beetle activity are HABITAT not defect in these contexts	none	
110	YES	Biomech	The concept of 'dynamic load factor' in tree biomechanics refers to:	Static weight of the tree	Amplification of forces during movement such as swaying	Soil bearing capacity	Root growth rate	1	Dynamic loading occurs during motion - wind-induced sway creates forces much greater than static weight due to acceleration and momentum	Trees in motion experience forces 2-3x their static weight. Swaying amplifies loads through oscillation. Resonance can further increase forces. Critical factor in wind-loading failure	Dynamic loading mechanics: STATIC LOAD - Tree's own weight. Constant. Predictable. Wood and roots designed to support this easily.<br>DYNAMIC LOAD - Forces from movement. Wind causes sway. Acceleration creates additional forces. Can be 2-4x static load depending on frequency and amplitude.<br>AMPLIFICATION - Oscillation back and forth builds amplitude. Each cycle adds energy if frequency matches natural sway period. Resonance can dramatically increase forces. Damping (friction) dissipates some energy but not all.<br>Natural frequency: SWAY PERIOD - Time for tree to complete one back-and-forth oscillation. Depends on height mass and flexibility. Tall slender trees have longer periods. RESONANCE - If wind gusts match natural frequency amplitude increases dramatically. Catastrophic loading possible. Most dangerous scenario. DAMPING - Foliage crown friction internal wood friction dissipate energy. Reduce amplitude. Leafless trees (winter) have less damping and can develop higher amplitudes.<br>Wind loading scenarios: STEADY WIND - Creates constant bending load. Trees lean but load relatively predictable. GUSTY WIND - Variable force. Can excite natural frequency. Dynamic amplification. TURBULENT WIND - Chaotic gusts. Most dangerous. Can catch tree at maximum displacement and add force. Storm conditions.<br>Failure mechanisms: TRUNK SNAP - Maximum bending stress exceeds wood strength. Usually at point of maximum stress (often mid-height or at defects). ROOT PLATE FAILURE - Dynamic forces exceed anchorage capacity. Roots fail in tension or soil fails in shear. Tree overturns. BRANCH FAILURE - Branches have own natural frequencies. Can fail while stem remains.<br>Risk factors for dynamic failure: TALL SLENDER FORM - High natural frequency. Large amplitude potential. OPEN GROWN - Sudden exposure to wind. Not adapted. DECAY/DEFECTS - Reduce strength. Failure occurs at lower load. SHALLOW ROOTS - Inadequate anchorage. SATURATED SOIL - Reduced soil strength. Roots fail more easily.<br>Species variation: FLEXIBLE SPECIES (willow poplar) - Bend more. Avoid snap failure but may uproot. RIGID SPECIES (oak) - Less flexible. More prone to stem snap. BRITTLE WOOD - Fails suddenly without warning.<br>Assessment implications: Don't only consider static loads. Dynamic amplification is critical in storms. Trees that survive normal winds can fail in storms due to dynamic effects. Gusts matching natural frequency are worst case - consider site wind patterns	none	
111	YES	Disease	Nectria canker (Neonectria ditissima) on apple and beech causes:	Enhanced growth	Sunken cankers with concentric ridges and branch dieback	Improved flowering	Stronger roots	1	Nectria canker forms distinctive target-like lesions with concentric rings of dead tissue and callus - progressive disease that girdles branches and causes dieback	Fungus kills cambium in annual cycles. Tree attempts to callus over. Next year fungus advances again. Creates characteristic concentric pattern	Nectria canker: PATHOGEN - Neonectria ditissima (formerly Nectria galligena). Fungal disease.<br>HOSTS - Apples pears most commonly. Also beech birch ash maple. Common in UK.<br>SYMPTOMS - Sunken elliptical cankers on branches and stems. Concentric rings visible (target-like pattern). Each ring equals one year of growth. Callus ridges surround canker. Cracked bark in center. Red pustules (fruiting bodies) on canker surface autumn/winter. Branch dieback beyond canker.<br>PROGRESSION - Fungus infects through wounds (pruning cuts frost damage). Kills cambium and underlying tissue. Tree produces callus attempting to wall off infection. Fungus breaks through callus next growing season. Advances further. Repeated annually. Eventually girdles branch.<br>FAVORABLE CONDITIONS - Wet springs and autumns. Wounds and frost cracks provide entry. Stressed trees more susceptible.<br>Impact: BRANCH GIRDLING - Canker expands around circumference. Cuts off vascular transport. Branch dies beyond canker. WEAKENING - Cankered branches prone to breakage. Structural integrity reduced. YIELD LOSS - In fruit trees reduces fruiting. Dieback impacts production. TREE DECLINE - Severe infections on main stem or scaffold branches can kill entire tree.<br>Management: PRUNING - Remove infected branches. Cut well below canker into healthy wood. Dispose of infected material (burn - don't compost). TIMING - Prune during dry periods. Minimizes spore spread. Avoid wet weather. WOUND PROTECTION - Minimize unnecessary wounds. Proper pruning technique. Paint large wounds with protective coating (controversial - may trap moisture). SANITATION - Clean tools between cuts. Sterilize with disinfectant. RESISTANT VARIETIES - Some apple cultivars more resistant. Select appropriately. CANKER REMOVAL - On valuable trees may attempt to excise cankers surgically. Remove diseased tissue back to healthy wood. Limited success.<br>Prognosis: Progressive disease. Won't resolve without intervention. Removal of infected material essential. Severe infections may require tree removal.<br>Recognition: CONCENTRIC RINGS diagnostic. Target pattern unmistakable. RED PUSTULES (perithecia) confirm Nectria. Visible in autumn/winter with hand lens.<br>Compare to other cankers: NECTRIA - Concentric target pattern. Red fruiting bodies. BACTERIAL CANKER - Sunken with gumming. No concentric pattern. PHYTOPHTHORA - Bleeding canker. Tarry exudate. Lower stem. Different appearance.<br>Specific ID important for appropriate management	none	
112	YES	Defect	A large wound with extensive decay but strong compensatory growth (thick callus ridges and buttressing around defect) suggests:	Immediate failure	Tree is actively managing the defect and may be stable	Certain death within months	No structural implications	1	Vigorous compensatory growth shows tree is responding to structural stress by reinforcing the area - indicates vitality and successful adaptation	Tree detects stress around wound and adds wood where needed. Callus tissue attempts to close wound. Buttressing reinforces weak area. Signs of active healthy response	Compensatory growth assessment: CALLUS FORMATION - Wound wood rolls over injury edges. Attempts to close wound and compartmentalize decay. Vigorous callus indicates good tree vitality.<br>BUTTRESSING - Ribs or flanges of wood form adjacent to defect. Transfer loads around weak area. Thickened growth on stressed sides.<br>ECCENTRIC GROWTH RINGS - Growth rings wider on loaded sides. Visible evidence of wood placement where stress is highest. Axiom of Uniform Stress in action.<br>Interpretation: COMPENSATION PRESENT - Tree is RESPONDING. Has vigor. Is ADAPTING to structural situation. Positive sign. AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION - Extensive indicates tree working hard to manage problem. Marginal indicates limited capacity or recent damage. CONTINUING vs OLD - Active ongoing callusing vs old static callus. Ongoing better - shows continued vitality.<br>Risk assessment with compensation: DEFECT SIZE vs COMPENSATION - Large defect with good compensation may be acceptable. Same defect with no compensation is higher risk. SHELL ADEQUACY - Even with compensation must evaluate remaining shell thickness. Compensation doesn't eliminate risk just reduces it. LOADING - Consider wind exposure crown size. Forces acting on compromised area. TIME FRAME - Compensation takes years. Recent large wound hasn't had time to compensate yet - higher immediate risk.<br>Management implications: RETAIN AND MONITOR - Trees showing strong compensation often can be retained. Regular inspection to ensure compensation continues and defect doesn't propagate. REDUCE LOADING IF CONCERNED - Crown reduction can lessen forces on defect area. Gives tree time to continue compensating. RESPECT THE RESPONSE - Don't remove compensatory growth thinking it's abnormal. It's the tree's adaptation. Critical.<br>Absence of compensation: DECLINING TREES - No compensatory response indicates limited vigor. Tree cannot respond to stress. Higher concern. RECENT DAMAGE - Too soon for compensation to develop. Re-assess in future to see if response occurs. EXTREME STRESS - Sometimes stress so severe tree cannot mount effective response. Poor prognosis.<br>Species variation: Fast-growing species (willow poplar lime) produce vigorous callus quickly. Slow-growing species (oak beech) compensate more slowly but effectively. Species-specific expectations matter.<br>Veteran trees: Ancient trees often show extensive compensatory growth around historic wounds. This is how they've survived centuries. Compensation is key to longevity. Respect and protect it	none	
113	YES	Pest	Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis) is a serious threat because:	It improves ash timber	It kills ash trees rapidly and is difficult to control once established	It only affects dead ash	It prevents ash dieback	1	EAB larvae bore under bark disrupting vascular tissue and killing ash trees typically within 2-4 years of infestation - devastating invasive pest	Not yet present in UK but established in North America and European Russia. Would be catastrophic if it arrived. Kills nearly all ash trees. Combines with ash dieback for double threat	Emerald Ash Borer: DESCRIPTION - Metallic green beetle 8-14mm long. Larvae white flattened feed under bark. D-shaped exit holes 3-4mm diagnostic.<br>HOSTS - All ash species (Fraxinus). Healthy trees attacked - doesn't require stress or disease. High host specificity.<br>DAMAGE - Larvae bore galleries under bark in cambium and phloem. Disrupts vascular transport. Girdling effect. Crown dieback yellowing thinning. Tree death typically 2-4 years. Woodpecker damage on trunk (birds feed on larvae). D-shaped exit holes.<br>LIFECYCLE - Adults emerge May-July. Feed on ash foliage. Females lay eggs in bark crevices. Larvae hatch bore into bark. Feed under bark for 1-2 years. Pupate under bark. Adults emerge through D-shaped holes.<br>SPREAD - Adults fly up to 10km. Long-distance spread via infested ash firewood and nursery stock. Easily transported.<br>STATUS - Not in UK (as of 2024). Established in North America (widespread - millions of trees killed). Present in European Russia. Expanding westward. High priority for UK surveillance.<br>IMPACT IF ESTABLISHED UK - Would kill most UK ash (already stressed by ash dieback). Double impact of two deadly threats. Landscape change. Ecological devastation.<br>Management if found: IMMEDIATE NOTIFICATION - Notifiable quarantine pest. Report to APHA immediately. QUARANTINE - No movement of ash wood or material from area. Strict biosecurity. ERADICATION ATTEMPTS - Extensive tree removal around infested area. Create buffer zones. Intensive surveillance. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL - Parasitoid wasps being researched. Natural enemies from native range. Shows promise but not yet fully effective.<br>Challenges: DIFFICULT TO DETECT EARLY - Symptoms appear after years of infestation. HARD TO CONTROL - Insecticides difficult to apply to large trees. Expensive. Environmental concerns. RAPID SPREAD - Adults disperse readily. Firewood movement spreads long distances.<br>Prevention: BIOSECURITY - Don't import ash wood from abroad. Burn firewood locally (don't transport). Inspect ash regularly. Report suspicious signs. PUBLIC AWARENESS - Recognize symptoms. Know D-shaped holes. Report sightings.<br>Prognosis if established: Without effective control EAB would likely kill 90%+ of UK ash. Combined with ash dieback equals near-total loss of species from landscape. Worst-case scenario for ash	none	
114	YES	Biomech	Trees with high slenderness ratio (height to diameter ratio greater than 80) are at increased risk of:	Improved stability	Buckling failure under self-weight or wind loading	Enhanced growth	Better anchorage	1	Slender trees are more prone to buckling - tall stems with inadequate taper act like tall thin columns that can buckle under compression or bending loads	Slenderness ratio H/D (height divided by diameter at base) indicates buckling risk. Greater than 80 concerning. Greater than 100 high risk. Common in suppressed then suddenly released trees	Slenderness ratio: DEFINITION - Height (H) divided by diameter at breast height (DBH). Dimensionless number.<br>INTERPRETATION - Less than 50 = stable stocky tree. 50-80 = normal range. Greater than 80 = slender vulnerable to buckling. Greater than 100 = high risk.<br>MEASUREMENT - Height in meters. DBH in centimeters (measured at 1.3m height). H/D ratio calculated.<br>Causes of high slenderness: SUPPRESSION - Tree grows in dense stand. Competes for light. Grows tall seeking light but remains slender due to crowding. LIMITED CROWN - Small crown produces limited photosynthate. Cannot support thickening. SUDDEN RELEASE - Thinning or adjacent tree fall. Suddenly exposed to wind. Not adapted. Tall slender stem vulnerable.<br>Buckling mechanics: COMPRESSION LOADING - Wind creates compression on leeward side. Slender stem may buckle like column. BENDING - Combined bending and compression. Buckling occurs on compression side. CRITICAL HEIGHT - For given diameter there is maximum stable height. Beyond this buckling occurs. Slenderness ratio predicts this.<br>Risk factors: POOR TAPER - Stem same diameter top to bottom. Inefficient structure. WEAK WOOD - Species with soft weak wood more vulnerable. WIND EXPOSURE - Sudden exposure after thinning. Not wind-firm. TOP-HEAVY CROWN - Heavy crown on slender stem. High center of gravity.<br>Management: GRADUAL THINNING - Don't suddenly expose slender trees. Thin gradually over years. Allows adaptation. REDUCE HEIGHT - Topping or crown reduction. Reduces H/D ratio. Lowers center of gravity. ACCEPT LOSSES - Some slender trees will fail after thinning. Unavoidable. FUTURE MANAGEMENT - Thin stands earlier. Prevent development of high slenderness.<br>Species variation: Fast-growing softwoods (Sitka spruce) prone to high slenderness in plantations. Hardwoods usually develop better taper naturally.<br>Assessment: Calculate H/D ratio. Greater than 80 indicates elevated risk. Examine taper - parallel stem worse than tapered. Consider exposure level. Prioritize for reduction or removal if over targets.<br>Natural selection: In forests slender trees often fail naturally. This is normal thinning process. Self-thinning. In amenity settings failures create risk - must manage proactively	none	
115	YES	Disease	Honey fungus (Armillaria) is particularly problematic because:	It only affects deadwood	It can spread through soil via rhizomorphs attacking living roots of healthy trees	It improves soil quality	It grows only above ground	1	Armillaria spreads underground through bootlace-like rhizomorphs that can travel several meters and infect new hosts - aggressive root pathogen that kills trees	Rhizomorphs spread independently of root contact. Survive in soil for years. Can bridge gaps. Infect susceptible hosts when roots contact. Very difficult to control once established	Armillaria (Honey Fungus): SPECIES - Several Armillaria species. A. mellea most pathogenic and aggressive. A. gallica less virulent. A. ostoyae A. cepistipes A. tabescens.<br>SPREAD MECHANISMS - ROOT CONTACT - Direct spread tree-to-tree where roots touch. RHIZOMORPHS - Black/brown bootlace structures. Grow through soil independently. Travel 3-5+ meters. Infect when they contact roots. Highly persistent.<br>HOSTS - Very broad host range. Attacks hundreds of tree and shrub species. Especially conifers stressed trees recently transplanted. Some species resistant (many conifers Robinia).<br>SYMPTOMS - Crown thinning yellowing dieback. White mycelial fans under bark at root collar (DIAGNOSTIC - this is the gold standard for ID). Black rhizomorphs in soil under bark on roots. Honey-colored toadstools autumn (not always present). Resinosis in conifers.<br>DECAY TYPE - White rot of roots and root collar. Rarely extends up stem. Progressive. Fatal.<br>IMPACT - Causes root plate failure and windthrow. Tree stability compromised before obvious crown symptoms. Sudden failure possible.<br>Detection: ROOT COLLAR EXCAVATION - Essential. Remove soil expose root flare. Peel back bark. Look for white mycelial fans (definitive diagnostic). Probe for rhizomorphs in soil. TOADSTOOLS - If present confirm Armillaria but absence doesn't rule it out. Fruit intermittently. DIAGNOSTIC CERTAINTY - Mycelial fans are POSITIVE ID. Nothing else looks like this.<br>Management challenges: NO CURE - Cannot treat infected trees. Progression inevitable. PERSISTENCE - Rhizomorphs and mycelium survive in stumps and dead roots for years (A. mellea) or decades. Site remains infectious. SPREAD - Difficult to prevent. Physical barriers (trenching to 1m depth) sometimes attempted. Often impractical. Removing stumps and major roots reduces inoculum but difficult and expensive. SUSCEPTIBLE PLANTINGS - New trees on site with Armillaria may become infected. Consider resistant species or accept risk.<br>Species-specific virulence: A. MELLEA - Most aggressive. Attacks wide host range. Persistent rhizomorphs. Worst species. A. GALLICA - Less virulent. Many infected trees survive for years in equilibrium. Still causes problems but less severe. A. OSTOYAE - Particularly affects conifers. Serious in forests.<br>Risk assessment: Trees with Armillaria - Windthrow risk HIGH. Root plate compromised. Minimal warning before failure. URGENT assessment of stability. Probe root plate. Consider pulling test. Assume poor anchorage.<br>Future site use: Sites with Armillaria history - Choose resistant species (Catalpa Cercis Fagus Ginkgo Juglans Robinia some others). Avoid susceptible species (Betula Malus Prunus Sorbus many conifers).<br>Management in landscapes: Remove infected trees including stumps if practical. Inspect adjacent trees. Expect further infections. Monitor closely. Accept that Armillaria is endemic and persistent - cannot be eradicated from landscape	none	
116	YES	Defect	Exposed heartwood with no decay and smooth hard surface indicates:	Active decay in progress	Old wound that has dried and is unlikely to decay further if protected	Fresh injury requiring immediate treatment	Certain decay development	1	Dry exposed heartwood with hard surface is relatively resistant to decay - lack of moisture prevents fungal colonization	Heartwood is dead tissue containing extractives (natural preservatives). When dry fungal spores cannot germinate. Moisture is essential for decay. Hard dry heartwood stable	Heartwood characteristics: STRUCTURE - Dead xylem cells. No living content. Provides structural support only.<br>EXTRACTIVES - Contains phenolic compounds tannins resins. Naturally preserve wood. Resist decay.<br>MOISTURE - Typically lower moisture content than sapwood.<br>DURABILITY - Naturally decay-resistant when dry. Species-dependent - oak cedar naturally durable. Beech less durable.<br>Exposed heartwood scenarios: WOUNDS - Bark and sapwood removed. Heartwood exposed. CAVITIES - Decay removed sapwood leaving heartwood surface. MECHANICAL DAMAGE - Impact or storm damage exposes interior.<br>Decay resistance factors: MOISTURE CONTENT - Below 20-25% most decay fungi cannot grow. Dry heartwood below this threshold. EXPOSED SURFACE - Dries readily. Air circulation removes moisture. EXTRACTIVES - Toxic or inhibitory to many fungi. Natural protection. SPECIES - Oak cedar yew very durable. Beech willow birch less durable.<br>Risk of decay: WET CONDITIONS - Persistent moisture allows colonization. Wood in contact with soil or in cavities with standing water. SAPWOOD ATTACHED - Living sapwood provides moisture and nutrients for fungi. Decay can then spread to heartwood. WOUND CLOSURE - Callus tissue growing over exposure can trap moisture. May actually increase decay risk if covers wound before heartwood dries.<br>Management: ALLOW DRYING - Don't seal wounds. Promotes drying and prevents decay. OLD PRACTICE of wound dressings now discouraged. DRAINAGE - Ensure water doesn't pool in cavities. Drill weep holes if necessary. CLEAN WOUNDS - Remove loose bark jagged edges. Create smooth surface that sheds water. MONITOR - Inspect periodically. Check for softening (decay initiation). Probe to assess condition.<br>Don't fill cavities: OLD PRACTICE - Cavities filled with concrete cement foam. CURRENT UNDERSTANDING - Fills trap moisture increase decay risk. Prevent inspection. Generally NOT recommended. Modern approach - leave open allow drying inspect regularly.<br>Species considerations: DURABLE SPECIES (oak cedar) - Exposed heartwood can remain sound for centuries. Low risk. LESS DURABLE SPECIES (willow poplar) - Decay more likely even when dry. Higher risk.<br>Assessment of old exposure: If heartwood has been exposed for years and remains hard and sound likely to continue. Stable situation. LOW RISK. If heartwood soft or crumbly decay has colonized. ACTIVE DECAY. Higher risk. Probe to assess	none	
117	YES	Pest	Which pest creates distinctive blister-like galls on lime (Tilia) leaves?	Aphids	Eriophyid mites	Scale insects	Caterpillars	1	Eriophyid mites (gall mites) cause characteristic nail galls on lime leaves - small conical projections on upper surface with opening beneath	Mites feed on leaf tissue causing cells to proliferate abnormally. Form protective gall. Distinctive appearance. Common on lime trees. Cosmetic damage only - not serious pest	Lime nail gall (Eriophyes tiliae): DESCRIPTION - Microscopic mites (too small to see without magnification). Cause galls on lime leaves.<br>GALL APPEARANCE - Conical projections 3-5mm tall on UPPER leaf surface. Red pink or green colored. Opening on LOWER surface where mites enter. Numerous galls per leaf (can be hundreds).<br>DAMAGE - Purely aesthetic. No significant harm to tree health. Leaves remain functional despite galls. Common and widespread.<br>LIFECYCLE - Mites overwinter in bark crevices. Emerge spring. Migrate to developing leaves. Feed on leaf cells. Galls form around feeding site. Multiple generations per year. Galls persist through season.<br>HOSTS - Tilia species (limes). Common lime small-leaved lime silver lime. Very common in UK.<br>Management: USUALLY NONE NEEDED - Cosmetic issue only. Tree health not significantly affected. TOLERATE - Accept as natural occurrence. Galls are part of lime tree ecology in UK. NO PRACTICAL CONTROL - Mites protected inside galls. Inaccessible to sprays. Miticides not justified for aesthetic issue. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL - Predatory mites and other predators provide some control naturally.<br>Other eriophyid mites and galls: Many mite species cause galls on various trees. Examples: SYCAMORE PIMPLE GALL - Red pimples on sycamore leaves (Aceria). ASH GALL - Anthracnose-related galls on ash leaves. OAK GALLS - Various species cause different gall types. Generally cosmetic.<br>Distinction from other galls: WASPS - Cause different gall types (oak galls knopper galls). Round or complex shapes. APHIDS - Cause leaf curling and distortion. Sticky honeydew. FUNGAL GALLS - Leaf curl (Taphrina). Different appearance.<br>Recognition: NAIL GALLS on upper leaf surface equals eriophyid mites. LIME HOST plus nail galls equals Eriophyes tiliae. Common identification.<br>Public concern: Often noticed by public who worry about tree health. Reassure that cosmetic only. Tree will be fine. Galls are natural.<br>Lime in urban setting: Limes commonly planted as street and park trees. Nail galls very common. Part of normal lime tree appearance in UK. Don't warrant concern or treatment	none	
118	YES	Biomech	The term 'sudden summer branch drop' (SSBD) refers to:	Branches broken by storms	Large branches failing in calm conditions during summer	Planned pruning	Winter damage appearing in summer	1	SSBD is phenomenon where large branches fail suddenly on calm days in summer without obvious external cause - often on mature trees on hot still days	Also called 'sudden limb drop' or 'summer branch drop'. Occurs without wind or other loading. Branch simply detaches and falls. Mechanism not fully understood. Unpredictable	Sudden Summer Branch Drop: CHARACTERISTICS - Large branches (often scaffold limbs). Fail suddenly without warning. Calm weather conditions (no wind). Hot summer days typical. Clean break or tear at junction. No obvious external defect visible beforehand.<br>SPECIES - Commonly reported on oaks (especially Turkey oak English oak). Also beech cedar elm poplar plane. Mature/veteran trees.<br>PROPOSED MECHANISMS - Internal water stress causing brittle fracture. Hydraulic failure theories. Drying and shrinkage of green wood creating tension. Compression failure of fibers (cell collapse). Hidden internal defects (included bark decay co-dominant stems).<br>TRUTH - Mechanism not definitively proven. Likely multiple factors. Some cases have identifiable defects others apparently sound wood.<br>UNPREDICTABILITY - Cannot reliably predict which branches will fail. No obvious external indicators in many cases. Risk assessment difficult.<br>Risk factors (suspected): OLD TREES - Mature and veteran trees more affected. SUMMER HEAT - Hot days possibly triggers. Water stress theory. LARGE HORIZONTAL LIMBS - Heavy branches with high leverage. SPECIES - Oak beech particularly associated. DROUGHT - Possible contributing factor.<br>Management challenges: CANNOT PREVENT - No reliable way to identify at-risk branches before failure. INSPECTIONS - Regular inspections can identify some risk factors (cracks union defects). But many SSBD branches appeared sound. PRUNING - Reducing long heavy branches reduces risk somewhat. But doesn't eliminate. HAZARD TREES - In high-traffic areas may need to remove trees with history of SSBD. ACCEPT RISK - In low-traffic areas may accept low level of risk. Part of having mature trees.<br>Legal/liability implications: SSBD creates liability concerns. Failure in calm conditions harder to defend than storm damage. INSPECTIONS - Document inspections. Show due diligence. RISK ASSESSMENT - Rate trees near targets. Consider consequences. MANAGEMENT - Take reasonable precautions. But cannot eliminate all risk.<br>Historical context: SSBD recognized for over 100 years. Not new phenomenon. Part of natural tree behavior. More noticed now due to increased liability awareness.<br>Prevention strategies: STRUCTURAL PRUNING - Young trees develop good form. Reduce co-dominance. LOAD REDUCTION - Shorten heavy limbs before they become hazardous. REMOVE RISK TREES - Trees near constant high-traffic targets may warrant removal if SSBD history. SIGNAGE - Temporary closure during high-risk conditions (hot calm summer days) near suspect trees.<br>Research ongoing: Better understanding of mechanisms needed. Improved prediction methods sought. Remains somewhat mysterious despite long recognition	none	
119	YES	Defect	A recent lean with soil cracks radiating from base but no buttressing development indicates:	Long-established stable lean	Recent root failure or movement requiring urgent assessment	Improved stability	Normal seasonal movement	1	Recent lean without adaptive growth is a critical failure sign - soil cracks show root plate has moved and tree is unstable	Trees develop buttressing over years in response to lean. Absence proves lean is recent. Soil cracks show roots failing or have failed. Windthrow imminent	Assessment of leaning trees: RECENT LEAN indicators - Lean increased compared to old photos. No buttressing on tension side (downhill/away from lean). Fresh soil cracks radiating from base. Soil mounding on one side. Exposed roots on opposite side. Crown still oriented to old vertical (not adjusted to new lean).<br>ESTABLISHED LEAN indicators - Buttressing visible on tension side. Eccentric growth rings. Stem curves upward (crown reoriented). No fresh soil cracks. Historical photos show same angle. Root architecture adapted.<br>Soil crack interpretation: RADIAL CRACKS - Extend outward from trunk base. Indicate root plate rotating in soil. Tension side pulling upward compression side pushing down. WIDTH - Wider cracks indicate more movement. Narrow cracks (a few mm) early warning. Wide cracks (cm or more) significant failure. FRESH vs OLD - Fresh cracks have clean edges fresh soil exposed. Old cracks weathered vegetation growing in them. PATTERN - Cracks on one side (tension side typically). Asymmetric distribution.<br>Root plate behavior: INCIPIENT FAILURE - Root plate beginning to rotate. Early stage. Cracks visible but tree still standing. PROGRESSIVE FAILURE - Each wind event causes more movement. Roots fail incrementally. Stability decreases progressively. CATASTROPHIC FAILURE - Root plate fails completely. Windthrow. Tree overturns. Can be sudden with next wind event.<br>Urgency of assessment: RECENT LEAN with soil cracks is EMERGENCY. Imminent failure risk. IMMEDIATE action required. Barriers exclusion zone urgent assessment by specialist. DO NOT DELAY.<br>Investigation: DOCUMENT - Measure lean angle. Photograph cracks and base. Establish baseline. PROBE ROOT PLATE - Steel rod probe around base. Check for movement looseness. Depth of cracking. ROOT EXCAVATION - May carefully excavate to inspect root plate integrity. Extent of damage. PULLING TEST - Consider if safe to approach. Quantify stability. Usually reveals significant movement. HISTORY - Interview owner/manager. When did lean develop? Was there storm wind event other disturbance?<br>Management options: IMMEDIATE REMOVAL - Usually necessary. Tree unstable. Cannot be reliably stabilized. TEMPORARY SUPPORT - Guying or propping sometimes used to stabilize while arranging removal. Dangerous - failure can occur during setup. MONITOR - Rarely appropriate. Only if consequences minimal (remote location no targets). Photograph and measure but assume failure likely.<br>Prognosis: Recent leans with soil cracks rarely recover. Root plate integrity compromised. Progressive failure typical. Removal usually necessary. Don't delay - windthrow can occur any time especially during wind events	none	
120	YES	Pest	Oak galls caused by gall wasps (Cynipidae) are primarily:	Fatal to trees	Cosmetic issues causing little harm to tree health	Signs of root rot	Indicators of drought	1	Most oak galls are caused by tiny wasps that induce abnormal growth - generally harmless to tree health though can be unsightly	Gall wasps lay eggs in oak tissues. Chemical signals cause plant tissue to form gall around larva. Larva feeds inside protected gall. Completes development. Emerges. Tree unharmed. Complex lifecycles. Fascinating ecology	Oak galls (Cynipidae wasps): GALL TYPES - Many species create different galls. Marble galls oak apple galls silk button galls knopper galls spangle galls artichoke galls many others.<br>LOCATION - Leaves buds shoots acorns catkins. Species-specific locations.<br>FORMATION - Adult female wasp oviposits egg into plant tissue. Larva hatches secretes growth regulators. Plant tissue proliferates abnormally forming gall. Larva feeds inside. Protected from predators parasites weather.<br>EMERGENCE - Larva pupates inside gall. Adult wasp emerges. Leaves exit hole. Cycle repeats.<br>IMPACT ON TREE - Minimal. Galls are localized. Tree continues to function. Even heavy infestations usually not harmful. Aesthetic impact only.<br>COMPLEX LIFECYCLES - Many cynipid wasps have alternating sexual and asexual generations. Different galls for each generation. Alternate between oak species sometimes. Remarkable biology.<br>Common UK oak galls: KNOPPER GALLS - On developing acorns. Ridged irregular green/brown galls. Very common. Can reduce acorn crop (but not significant tree health impact). MARBLE GALLS - Spherical smooth green or brown. On leaves or twigs. Common. OAK APPLE - Large (up to 4cm) spongy galls on leaves or twigs. Light green to brown. SPANGLE GALLS - Small disc-like galls on underside of leaves. Many per leaf. Autumn. SILK BUTTON - Small cylindrical galls on underside of leaves.

121	YES	Biomech	Trees can adjust their growth in response to mechanical stress through a process called:	Phototropism	Thigmomorphogenesis	Geotropism	Chemotropism	1	Thigmomorphogenesis is growth response to mechanical stimulation - trees detect wind movement touch and adjust form accordingly	Trees sense mechanical stress (wind sway touch) and respond by altering growth patterns. Develop shorter stouter form. Strengthen structural tissues. Key adaptation to environment	Thigmomorphogenesis mechanisms: PERCEPTION - Trees detect mechanical stimulation through mechanoreceptors. Bending stress displacement movement all sensed.<br>SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION - Mechanical stimulus triggers hormonal and genetic responses. Calcium signaling ethylene production gene expression changes.<br>GROWTH RESPONSE - Altered cell division and expansion. Radial growth increased (thicker stem). Height growth reduced (shorter plant). Wood properties change (denser stronger).<br>Ecological significance: WIND EXPOSURE - Trees in windy sites develop shorter stockier form. Wind-firm. Less likely to break. FOREST vs OPEN - Forest trees tall slender compete for light protected by neighbors. Open-grown trees shorter stockier exposed to wind constantly. STAKING - Stakes prevent movement. Reduces thigmomorphic response. Trees develop poorly without movement.<br>Practical implications: DON'T STAKE unnecessarily - Young trees benefit from movement. Develops taper and strength. Stakes should allow movement. Only use if absolutely necessary for anchorage. EXPOSURE - Sudden exposure (adjacent tree removal) stresses trees not wind-firm. Gradual exposure allows adaptation. SELECTION - Nursery stock grown too sheltered may not adapt well to exposed sites. Consider provenance.<br>Wood structure: REACTION WOOD - Compression wood (conifers) and tension wood (broadleaves) are thigmomorphic responses. Form in response to mechanical loading. JUVENILE vs MATURE WOOD - Transition affected by mechanical environment. DENSITY - Wind-exposed trees often have denser wood. Shorter growth rings. Stronger material.<br>Species variation: Some species very responsive (poplars birch). Others less so (oaks). Genetic variation in sensitivity.<br>Assessment implications: FORM - Short stocky trees in exposed sites are adapted. NORMAL and GOOD. Tall slender trees suddenly exposed are vulnerable. Poor taper due to previous shelter. MANAGEMENT - Consider mechanical environment in planning. Protect from sudden exposure if possible.<br>Research applications: Understanding thigmomorphogenesis helps predict tree responses. Relevant to climate change (changing wind patterns). Forestry thinning practices. Urban tree management.<br>Hormonal involvement: ETHYLENE - Key hormone in thigmomorphic response. Increased ethylene production following mechanical stimulation. AUXINS - Growth regulators affected by mechanical stress. Redistribution influences growth patterns.<br>Long-term adaptation: Repeated mechanical stimulation over years shapes tree form. Permanent structural adaptation. Trees remember loading history through wood structure	none	
122	YES	Disease	Tar spot (Rhytisma acerinum) on sycamore and maple leaves is:	Fatal disease requiring removal	Cosmetic fungal leaf spot causing minimal harm	Sign of root failure	Indicator of drought stress	1	Tar spot creates distinctive black tar-like spots on maple leaves - unsightly but causes minimal damage to tree health	Fungal disease overwinters on fallen leaves. Spores infect new leaves in spring. Black spots develop through summer. Premature leaf drop possible but tree health rarely affected	Tar spot disease: PATHOGEN - Rhytisma acerinum. Fungus specific to Acer species (maples).<br>SYMPTOMS - Large (5-20mm) raised black spots on upper leaf surface. Tar-like appearance. Yellow halo around spots initially. Multiple spots per leaf. Develops mid-summer onward. Most visible by late summer/autumn.<br>LIFECYCLE - Overwinters on fallen leaves on ground. Apothecia (fruiting bodies) mature in spring. Spores released coinciding with leaf emergence. Infect young leaves. Latent period (no symptoms) several weeks. Spots appear and enlarge through summer.<br>IMPACT - Aesthetic only. Unsightly leaves. May cause premature leaf drop in heavy infections. Generally does NOT significantly harm tree health. Even heavy repeated annual infections tolerated.<br>HOSTS - Sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) most commonly and severely affected in UK. Also Norway maple (A. platanoides) field maple (A. campestre) other Acer species.<br>Management: LEAF REMOVAL - Removing and destroying infected leaves in autumn breaks lifecycle. Reduces inoculum for next year. Practical for small trees. Impractical for large trees. FUNGICIDES - Generally not warranted. Expensive impractical for large trees. Environmental concerns. Disease is cosmetic. TOLERATE - Most appropriate approach. Accept as natural. Tree health not significantly impacted. SPECIES SELECTION - If tar spot aesthetics unacceptable in specific setting consider alternative species.<br>Public perception: Often causes concern. Looks dramatic. Reassure that tree is not dying. Cosmetic issue. Tree will be fine. Natural occurrence. Common in UK.<br>Favorable conditions: WET SPRINGS - Promote spore production and infection. Moist conditions during leaf emergence favor disease. SHELTERED SITES - Humid conditions. Less air movement. Typical for sycamore in UK climate - tar spot very common.<br>Recognition: LARGE BLACK TAR-LIKE SPOTS on maple leaves equals tar spot. DIAGNOSTIC - nothing else looks like this.<br>Different from: SOOTY MOLD - Black coating wipes off. Associated with aphid honeydew. Different appearance. OTHER LEAF SPOTS - Smaller various colors brown black with different patterns. Tar spot is distinctive.<br>Research: Tar spot used in studies of fungal-plant interactions. Biotrophic fungus (feeds on living tissue). Interesting biology. No significant threat - low priority for control research.<br>Ecological role: Part of natural sycamore/maple ecosystem. Decomposers in leaf litter. Food source for some invertebrates. Not viewed as problem in natural settings. Urban concern only where appearance matters	none	
123	YES	Defect	A branch collar that is swollen and prominent indicates:	Recent branch death	Normal healthy branch attachment	Decay in the collar	Branch about to fail	1	Prominent branch collar shows strong attachment and proper branch-trunk junction - indicates good structural connection and tree health	Branch collar is specialized tissue at branch base. Contains branch and trunk wood. Creates strong bond. Swollen collar is normal and healthy. Shows good branch development	Branch collar anatomy: STRUCTURE - Zone of intergrown branch and trunk tissues. Contains both branch wood (oriented along branch) and trunk wood (oriented along trunk). Collar forms ring around branch base.<br>FUNCTION - Provides strong mechanical attachment. Distributes stress from branch into trunk. Contains barrier zones that protect trunk if branch dies.<br>APPEARANCE - Swollen ridge at branch base. More prominent on some species/branches than others.<br>HEALTH INDICATOR - Well-developed collar indicates vigorous growth and good attachment.<br>Proper pruning: TARGET PRUNING - Remove branch just outside branch collar. Preserves collar tissue. Allows proper wound closure. FLUSH CUTS - Cutting into collar DAMAGES trunk tissue. Removes protective barriers. Larger wounds slower closure. Increased decay risk. IMPROPER.<br>Collar assessment: PROMINENT SWOLLEN COLLAR - Healthy strong attachment. Good sign. FLAT OR ABSENT COLLAR - May indicate co-dominant stems included bark weak attachment. Concerning. SUNKEN COLLAR - Sometimes indicates decay in union. Probe to check.<br>Species variation: DISTINCT COLLARS - Oak ash beech have very visible collars. Easy to identify proper pruning location. LESS DISTINCT - Some species have less obvious collars. Birch can be subtle. Care needed to identify correct cut location. BARK RIDGES - Branch bark ridge at top of union relates to collar. Ridge points to collar location. Both indicators used together.<br>Wound closure: PROPER CUTS outside collar - Callus forms from collar tissue. Rolls over wound. Efficient closure. FLUSH CUTS into trunk - Damage to trunk cambium. Larger wound. Slower closure. Decay more likely. Collar tissue critical for closure.<br>Decay resistance: COLLAR CONTAINS PROTECTION ZONES - Chemical and structural barriers. If branch dies or is removed barriers prevent decay spread into trunk. PRESERVING COLLAR - Essential for tree defense. Don't damage during pruning.<br>Natural branch shedding: CLADOPTOSIS - Trees naturally shed branches. Collar tissue forms abscission zone. Branch sealed off. Eventually drops. Collar protects trunk. Proper pruning mimics this natural process.<br>Recognition of good attachment: Branch with WELL-DEVELOPED COLLAR plus WIDE ANGLE plus NO INCLUDED BARK equals GOOD STRONG ATTACHMENT. Low failure risk.<br>Management: RETAIN well-attached branches with good collars. PRUNE properly respecting collar. CONTRAST poorly attached branches (narrow angle included bark weak collar) - higher failure risk.<br>Assessment in unions: LOOK FOR COLLAR tissue in unions. Presence indicates some wood connection. Absence may indicate included bark throughout. Use as indicator of union quality	none	
124	YES	Pest	Which pest creates tent-like silk nests in oak trees and has toxic hairs?

White silken tents visible. Caterpillars have thousands of toxic hairs. Serious human and animal health hazard. Notifiable UK pest	Oak Processionary Moth details: Already covered extensively in Q97. Key distinguishing features from similar pests: SILKEN NESTS - White tent-like structures on TRUNK and BRANCHES (not just in branch forks like some other tent caterpillars). TOXIC HAIRS - Urticating setae with thaumetopoein. Severe reactions. Other tent-making species lack toxic hairs. PROCESSION BEHAVIOR - Move nose-to-tail in lines (gives name). Distinctive behavior. HOST - OAK specific. Other tent caterpillars use different hosts. TIMING - Visible May-July in UK. Adults fly July-August.<br>Comparison to other tent-makers: COMMON TENT CATERPILLAR (Malacosoma) - Not in UK. Makes tents in branch forks. No toxic hairs. FALL WEBWORM (Hyphantria) - Makes tents on branch ends (not trunk). Late summer. No toxic hairs. Not in UK. GYPSY MOTH - Doesn't make tents. Different ecology. Toxic hairs in some stages but less severe than OPM.<br>Management: See Q97 for full management. KEY: Do NOT touch. Report to DEFRA. Professional treatment only. Public health priority.<br>Legal requirements: NOTIFIABLE pest under Plant Health Order. Legal duty to report sightings. Landowner must take action if present on property. Failure to comply is offense.<br>Current UK distribution: Established in greater London and surrounding counties. Subject to eradication/containment program. Spreading slowly despite efforts. Surveillance ongoing.<br>Recognition: WHITE SILK NEST on OAK TRUNK with PROCESSIONARY CATERPILLARS equals OPM. Report immediately. Critical to distinguish from harmless species - OPM has serious health implications	none	
125	YES	Biomech	A tree showing spiral cracking often indicates it was struck by:	Wind damage	Lightning	Vehicle impact	Frost	1	Lightning often creates distinctive spiral cracks as electricity follows moisture paths through wood traveling down tree in spiral pattern	Lightning strikes create intense heat and steam. Wood splits explosively. Spiral crack pattern common as current follows grain and moisture. Bark often stripped in spiral. Characteristic damage	Lightning strike effects: SPIRAL CRACK - Electrical current follows moisture in wood. Often follows spiral grain. Creates spiral split/crack as wood explodes from steam pressure.<br>BARK STRIPPING - Bark blown off along current path. Spiral or vertical strip of exposed wood. Steam explosion separates bark.<br>ENTRY AND EXIT - Entry point often top of tree (leader or upper branches). Exit point at base where current enters ground through roots. Current path visible as damage strip.<br>INTERNAL DAMAGE - Wood shattered internally. Cambium killed along path. Vascular system disrupted.<br>ROOT DAMAGE - Current exits through roots into ground. Root tissue damaged. May not be visible above ground.<br>Symptoms: IMMEDIATE - Visible split bark stripped. Sometimes smoke or fire. Sapwood exposed along crack. DELAYED - Crown dieback over weeks to months. Branches die back from damaged vascular tissue. Progressive decline possible. LONG-TERM - Decay colonizes damaged tissue. Progressive structural failure. Tree may die within years or survive if damage limited.<br>Species susceptibility: TALL ISOLATED TREES most at risk. Highest point in landscape. Trees near water (higher moisture content). LIGHTNING RODS - Oaks poplars pines often struck (tall water-loving species). LESS RISK - Trees in groups (effect spreads among multiple trees). Shorter trees (less likely to be highest point).<br>Assessment after strike: DOCUMENT DAMAGE - Photograph. Measure extent of crack/stripped bark. FOLLOW CRACK - Trace from top to base. Determine full extent. CHECK ROOTS - Excavate if necessary. Root damage may be significant but hidden. EVALUATE VIABILITY - Extensive damage (crack around much of circumference) equals poor prognosis. Limited damage may heal. MONITOR - Crown dieback may develop over months. Re-evaluate. Delayed effects common.<br>Management: LIMITED DAMAGE - May survive. Monitor. Tree may compartmentalize. EXTENSIVE DAMAGE - Poor prognosis. Remove if high failure risk or target present. Consider structural stability. SAFETY - Recently struck trees may drop branches. Wood weakened. Approach with caution. DECAY ENTRY - Damaged tissue entry for pathogens. Decay likely in coming years. Long-term instability risk.<br>Prevention: LIGHTNING PROTECTION SYSTEMS - Can be installed on high-value trees. Copper conductors from crown to ground rod. Expensive. Used for historic/specimen trees. Not practical for most trees. ACCEPT RISK - Lightning strikes are rare. Part of natural tree mortality. Low probability event.<br>Historical scars: Old lightning scars visible on many veteran trees. Spiral cracks with callused edges. Tree survived and adapted. Shows lightning strikes are survivable with good tree response. Not always fatal.<br>Recovery factors: EXTENT OF DAMAGE - Less than 25% circumference affected equals good survival chance. More than 50% equals poor. SPECIES VIGOR - Vigorous trees compartmentalize better. TREE SIZE - Large trees have more resources to respond. Young trees may be killed outright. DAMAGE LOCATION - Strike to main stem more serious than branch only	none	
126	YES	Fungi	Beech with a large pale buff perennial bracket at the base causing white rot of the butt - which fungus?	Armillaria mellea	Perenniporia fraxinea	Meripilus giganteus	Fomes fomentarius	1	Perenniporia fraxinea causes white rot of beech butts and produces distinctive pale buff perennial brackets with brown pore surfaces	Common on mature beech. Brackets persist year-round. Add new pore layer annually. Serious root and butt decay. High windthrow risk	Perenniporia fraxinea: HOSTS - Beech primary host. Occasionally ash (despite species name).<br>BRACKETS - Perennial hoof-shaped or shelf-like. Pale buff to cream upper surface. Brown pore surface bruises darker brown. 10-30cm diameter. Woody hard texture.<br>LOCATION - Basal - at root collar or within 1-2m of ground. Often on buttress roots.<br>DECAY TYPE - White rot. Attacks roots root collar and lower stem. Simultaneous degradation of lignin and cellulose. Wood becomes pale stringy fibrous.<br>PROGRESSION - Slow but relentless. Established infections progress over years to decades. Eventually compromises root plate.<br>FAILURE MODE - Windthrow primary concern. Root and butt decay reduces anchorage. Tree appears healthy in crown while root system failing.<br>IDENTIFICATION - Perennial bracket pale buff pore surface brown beech host basal location. Combination diagnostic.<br>ANNUAL RINGS - Bracket shows growth rings. Can count to estimate minimum age of infection.<br>Similar species: GANODERMA - Also beech butt rot. Brackets darker brown with zonate patterns. Spore deposit distinctive brown dust. MERIPILUS - Large rosette brackets at base. Bruise black not brown. Annual not perennial. Soft when fresh. FOMES - Grey hoof-shaped brackets. Not pale buff. Different host preference.<br>Assessment implications: SERIOUS DECAY - Perenniporia causes significant structural loss. WHITE ROT of roots equals windthrow risk. Stability assessment essential. Probe root plate excavate if necessary pulling test consideration. TARGET EVALUATION - Trees over high-value targets require urgent evaluation. MONITORING - Bracket presence indicates established decay. Assess stability regularly. Prognosis typically poor for retention in high-risk settings.<br>Management: ROOT PLATE ASSESSMENT critical. Extent of decay difficult to determine from bracket presence alone. May be localized or extensive. REMOVAL often necessary if over targets. RETAIN only if targets minimal and stability adequate. Regular re-assessment required. VETERAN STATUS - Ancient beech may have Perenniporia for decades. Accept higher risk if targets allow. Ecological value may outweigh safety concerns in appropriate settings	none	
127	YES	Fungi	Pine with brittle cube-like decay in heartwood and hoof-shaped red-brown perennial bracket - which fungus?	Armillaria mellea	Ganoderma applanatum	Fomitopsis pinicola	Meripilus giganteus	2	Fomitopsis pinicola causes brown rot in conifers producing distinctive reddish-brown hoof-shaped perennial brackets	Common on pine spruce fir. Brackets hard woody. Resinous appearance. Causes cubical brown rot typical of brown-rot fungi. Weakens stem	Fomitopsis pinicola: COMMON NAME - Red-belted polypore (UK) or Red-belted conk (US).<br>HOSTS - Conifers primary - pine spruce fir larch. Occasionally broadleaves.

Stem failure at decay location.<br>IDENTIFICATION - Hoof-shaped perennial bracket red-brown margin conifer host brown cubical decay. Distinctive combination.<br>Growth rings: Brackets show annual growth rings. Each ring equals one growing season. Useful for estimating infection age minimum.<br>Ecological role: Important deadwood decomposer. Saproxylic habitat. Indicator species of old-growth forests in some regions.<br>Assessment implications: BROWN ROT equals BRITTLE FAILURE risk. Wood snaps rather than bends. Sudden catastrophic failure mode. STEM LOCATION - If bracket high on stem assess drop zone. If basal assess windthrow potential. SHELL THICKNESS - Measure remaining sound wood. Brown rot reduces strength dramatically even with thick shell. More concerning than white rot of similar extent.<br>Management: BROWN ROT requires conservative assessment. Accept lower residual strength than white rot. REMOVE if over high-value targets and decay extensive. REDUCE LOADING if retention considered. Crown reduction lessen forces. MONITOR closely. Brown rot progresses and failure is sudden.<br>Recognition: RED-BROWN MARGIN when fresh (not always visible on old brackets). HOOF SHAPE. CONIFER HOST. Hard woody texture.<br>Similar fungi: FOMES FOMENTARIUS - Grey throughout. No red-brown. Different hosts (broadleaves). GANODERMA - Brown rot in some cases but appearance very different.

129	YES	Defect	Two co-dominant stems showing counterflexing (moving in opposite directions) and cracks on opposite sides suggest:	Excellent union strength	Torsional loading and progressive failure of the union	Recent successful pruning	Improved stability	1	Counterflexing creates torsional (twisting) loads on the union causing cracks to propagate on opposite sides as stems twist relative to each other	Each stem responds independently to wind. Differential movement creates twisting forces at union. Cracks initiated on opposite sides. Progressive failure mechanism. Dangerous configuration	Torsional loading in unions: MECHANISM - Two co-dominant stems sway independently in wind. Out-of-phase movement creates relative rotation. Union experiences twisting (torsion) loads. Different from simple bending.<br>CRACK PATTERN - Cracks appear on OPPOSITE sides of union. Not same side as in simple bending failure. Spiral or helical progression possible. Propagate with each loading cycle.<br>COUNTERFLEXING - Visible movement where stems bend in opposite directions simultaneously. Creates scissor-like motion at union. Extremely high stress.<br>INCLUDED BARK common in these configurations. Weak plane exists. Torsion exploits weakness.<br>Detection: OBSERVE IN WIND - Watch stems during moderate wind. Do they move independently? Opposite directions? CRACKS ON OPPOSITE SIDES - Diagnostic pattern. Suggests torsional loading not simple bending. SOUND - May hear creaking groaning during movement. Active failure in progress.<br>Risk factors: LARGE STEMS - Heavy. High momentum. Greater forces on union. NARROW ANGLE - V-shaped union concentrates stress. ASYMMETRIC CROWNS - Different wind loading on each stem. Encourages counterflexing. INCLUDED BARK - Reduces torsional resistance. No wood connection.<br>Assessment urgency: COUNTERFLEXING plus CRACKS equals CRITICAL HAZARD. Active progressive failure. Imminent collapse possible. IMMEDIATE action required. Do not delay. Failure can occur any time especially during wind.<br>Management: EMERGENCY REMOVAL typically required. Union integrity severely compromised. BARRIERS IMMEDIATELY - Exclude targets from fall zone until removal completed. CAREFUL REMOVAL - Tree may fail during operations. Extra safety precautions. May require specialized rigging. CABLING NOT APPROPRIATE - Cannot reliably prevent torsional failure. Cable may increase loading. Don't attempt to stabilize.<br>Contrast with simple bending: BENDING FAILURE - Cracks on ONE side (tension side). Both stems move together. Simpler loading pattern. TORSIONAL FAILURE - Cracks on OPPOSITE sides. Stems move independently. Complex loading. MORE DANGEROUS.<br>Prevention: STRUCTURAL PRUNING YOUNG - Remove co-dominant stems early. Establish single leader. REDUCE PROBLEMATIC UNIONS - Before they become large and hazardous. Maintenance pruning to maintain hierarchy.<br>Prognosis: Unions showing counterflexing and opposite-side cracks have POOR prognosis. Failure likely. Retention rarely advisable.<br>Engineering perspective: TORSIONAL STRENGTH - Wood weaker in torsion than bending. Unions particularly vulnerable. Grain orientation matters. Included bark eliminates torsional resistance almost entirely	none

Part of alder ecology. DECLINE - Infected trees show progressive dieback. May take years. Branch failure stem weakness. RIPARIAN CONCERN - Alders provide bank stabilization. Decay leads to failure potentially affecting erosion control. WINDTHROW - Weakened stems fail in storms. Along watercourses creates hazards.<br>Management considerations: RIPARIAN TREES - Alder along rivers important for ecology and bank stability. Balance decay risk with ecological value. REPLACEMENT - Consider planting new alders to replace declining infected trees. Maintain riparian function. HAZARD ASSESSMENT - Trees over paths roads buildings require evaluation. Failure risk increases with decay extent. NATURAL PROCESS - In natural woodland I. radiatus part of deadwood creation. Ecological role. Retention may be appropriate in low-risk settings.<br>Similar fungi: PHELLINUS - Also causes white rot of hardwoods but brackets are perennial woody. Different appearance.

STRUCTURAL EMERGENCY - Fresh cracks indicate compromised integrity. Urgent assessment required. Failure possible.<br>Investigation: DOCUMENT - Photograph measure. Establish baseline. HISTORY - Interview owner/manager. When did crack appear? Was there storm event? Any work done recently? Root damage? Exposure change? LOADING - Assess current loads. Crown size wind exposure recent weather. EXTENT - How much of circumference affected? How deep? Through stem or partial? CONSEQUENCES - What's below? People buildings vehicles? How urgent is risk? PROPAGATION CHECK - Mark crack ends. Re-inspect after wind event. Has it extended?<br>Management urgency: FRESH CRACK indicating ACUTE FAILURE equals IMMEDIATE PRIORITY. Do not delay. Barriers exclusion zone specialist assessment. Removal often necessary especially over targets. CANNOT assume crack will stabilize. May continue propagating.<br>Risk factors for continued propagation: LARGE CROWN - Heavy continued loading. WIND EXPOSURE - Frequent loading cycles. DECAY PRESENT - Associated internal decay. Crack may be symptom of more extensive hidden decay. LOADING CONTINUES - If cause of crack (wind exposure etc) continues crack will likely propagate further.<br>Monitoring if retained: MARK CRACK ENDS - Small marks on bark at top and bottom of crack. RE-INSPECT AFTER LOADING - After storms wind events. Has crack extended past marks? ASSUME PROPAGATION until proven otherwise. Act conservatively.<br>Contrast with old stable cracks: OLD CRACKS with good callus and no recent extension are LOWER RISK. Can often be monitored. FRESH CRACKS are ACTIVE and HIGH RISK. Require immediate intervention unless consequences minimal.<br>Prevention: Cannot prevent acute loading events. But can identify vulnerable trees beforehand.

Pale buff brackets. Basal location. White rot. Perennial brackets	Perenniporia fraxinea on ash: Despite 'fraxinea' (ash) in name this fungus is MORE COMMON on BEECH but does occur on ash. Causes white rot of roots and butt. Same characteristics as described in Q126. See Q126 for full details. Brackets perennial pale buff brown pore surface basal location. Progressive root and butt decay. Windthrow risk. Assessment and management identical to beech infections.<br>Host range: BEECH - Primary host most commonly affected. ASH - Secondary host. Less common than on beech but does occur. OTHER - Occasional reports on other hardwoods.<br>Species name misleading: Originally described from ash hence 'fraxinea'. Subsequently found to be more common on beech. Name retained despite primary host being beech. Confusion possible.<br>Recognition on ash: Same bracket appearance as on beech. Pale buff perennial pore surface brown. Basal location.<br>If on ash consider OTHER pathogens first: ARMILLARIA - More common on stressed ash especially with ash dieback. White mycelial fans diagnostic. KRETZSCHMARIA - Causes basal decay of ash. Diagnostic black stromata crusty patches. PERENNIPORIA - Less common on ash than above but does occur.

145	YES	Defect	Pronounced buttressing with hollow sound behind ribs suggests:	Solid healthy wood throughout	Adaptive growth masking internal decay	Normal root development	Recent excellent growth	1	Trees develop buttressing to compensate for internal weaknesses - hollow sound proves cavity or decay beneath external reinforcement	Tree adds wood externally where stress highest to compensate for internal decay. External appearance may look impressive while internal structure compromised	Compensatory buttressing assessment: MECHANISM - Tree detects stress. Internal decay reduces strength. Tree adds wood externally to compensate. Buttressing forms around weak area.<br>EXTERNAL APPEARANCE - Impressive pronounced ribs and flanges. Looks structurally strong.<br>INTERNAL REALITY - Cavity or extensive decay beneath buttresses. Hollow sound when buttress sounded.<br>ACOUSTIC TESTING - Tap or sound buttress with mallet. HOLLOW SOUND indicates cavity beneath. SOLID SOUND indicates sound wood.<br>Implications: COMPENSATION SUCCESS is POSITIVE - Tree IS responding. Has vigor to add wood. Successfully managing internal decay. DECAY EXTENT may be GREATER than external appearance suggests. Buttressing masks internal condition. ASSESSMENT REQUIRES probing sounding internal examination. Cannot judge by external buttressing alone.<br>Risk evaluation: ADEQUATE COMPENSATION - If buttressing substantial and hollow not too extensive may be structurally adequate. Shell thickness critical. INADEQUATE COMPENSATION - If decay extensive or progressing compensation may not maintain strength. FAILURE MODES - Consider if buttress itself could fail (peel away). Or if entire section could collapse.<br>Assessment methods: SOUNDING - Tap buttresses and stem. Compare responses. Locate hollow zones. PROBING - Increment borer resistograph through buttress. Determine shell thickness and cavity extent. TOMOGRAPHY - If high-value tree. Image internal structure. Quantify decay. EXCAVATION - Expose root buttresses. Examine base for decay. VISUAL - Openings cracks in buttresses. Clues to internal condition.<br>Management: QUANTIFY EXTENT - Don't assume buttressing equals safety. Measure actual shell thickness. SHELL THICKNESS RATIO (t/R) - Critical factor. Greater than 0.3 generally adequate. Less than 0.3 concerning. COMPENSATORY GROWTH - Positive sign but doesn't eliminate risk. Tree trying to manage.

Can carry spores and spread disease locally. But PRIMARY spread of ash dieback is by AIRBORNE SPORES not beetles.<br>SYMPTOMS - Multiple D-shaped holes in bark. Loose bark. Galleries visible under bark. Crown dieback. Tree decline.<br>Distinction from EAB: EMERALD ASH BORER (Agrilus planipennis) - INVASIVE. Not in UK. Larger beetle 8-14mm. Metallic green. Primary pathogen kills healthy ash. D-shaped holes but larger. ASH BARK BEETLE - NATIVE. Much smaller 2-3mm. Secondary pest on stressed ash. Part of natural ash ecology.<br>Assessment: PRESENCE indicates TREE STRESSED OR DECLINING. Look for underlying causes - ash dieback most likely. NOT PRIMARY KILLER but contributes to decline progression. Tree likely in poor condition already.<br>Management: NO DIRECT CONTROL practical or necessary. Native species part of ecosystem. ADDRESS UNDERLYING STRESS - Primarily ash dieback. No cure. REMOVE declining ash if hazardous. Beetle presence indicates advanced decline. BIOSECURITY - Don't move ash wood during growing season. May spread ash dieback spores.<br>Ash dieback context: ASH WEAKENED by dieback highly vulnerable to bark beetle attack. COMBINATION accelerates decline. Beetle colonization hastens death. VECTORS - Beetles can carry ash dieback spores on bodies. Contribute to local spread. But airborne spores are primary dispersal mechanism.<br>Ecological role: Natural part of ash ecology. Colonizes stressed and dead ash. Contributes to deadwood recycling. Food source for woodpeckers and other insectivores.<br>Recognition: D-SHAPED HOLES in ASH bark equals bark beetle activity. Small 1-2mm holes. Multiple holes. Loose bark areas	none	
162	YES	Biomech	Trees growing in consistent directional wind develop:	Symmetrical crowns	Flagging and adaptive asymmetric crown form	Taller height	Weaker stems	1	Chronic wind exposure causes flagging (crown deflection away from prevailing wind) and asymmetric growth - successful mechanical adaptation	Wind-adapted form is normal and stable. Flagging indicates chronic exposure not acute failure. Tree has remodeled structure. See Q33 for related concepts	Flagging and wind adaptation: FLAGGING - Crown deflected in direction of prevailing wind. Branches longer on leeward side shorter or absent on windward side.<br>MECHANISM - Wind damage to buds and shoots on windward side. Mechanical abrasion desiccation. Growth suppressed windward side.<br>ASYMMETRIC CROWN - Deliberately unbalanced. Adapted to environmental forces. NOT a defect.<br>STEM FORM - Often leaning slightly leeward. Eccentric growth rings. Thicker wood on windward side (compression).<br>KRUMMHOLZ - Extreme wind adaptation. Prostrate or shrub form. Alpine and coastal environments.<br>Assessment implications: FLAGGING equals WIND ADAPTATION. Tree successfully adapted. STABLE if long-established. No recent changes. CONCERN ONLY IF - Wind exposure changes (shelter removed). Or tree suddenly grows (increased sail area). Or root damage occurs. Otherwise accept as normal adapted form.<br>Species variation: FLEXIBLE SPECIES (willow poplar) flag readily. Survive by bending. BRITTLE SPECIES may lose branches rather than flag. Different strategy. CONIFERS often show pronounced flagging. Exposed sites common.<br>Management: ACCEPT FLAGGING as adaptation. Do NOT attempt to 'correct' or balance crown. Tree optimized for its environment. CONCERN if flagging CHANGES - New deflection suggests new exposure or weakening. Investigate. PROTECTION - If shelter removed gradually thin to allow adaptation. Don't sudden expose.<br>Prevention: GRADUAL EXPOSURE better than sudden. If removing adjacent trees do so incrementally. Allows adaptation time. SPECIES SELECTION - Choose wind-tolerant species for exposed sites. Appropriate species matters.<br>Recognition in assessment: Flagged tree in exposed site equals NORMAL ADAPTATION. Flagged tree in sheltered site equals INVESTIGATE - what changed? Stress indicated. Context matters.<br>Coastal and mountain trees: Extreme wind adaptation common. Flagging krummholz prostrate forms all normal. Part of natural vegetation patterns.<br>Engineering perspective: Asymmetric form reduces wind loading. Crown mass concentrated leeward reduces overturning moment. Mechanically efficient for wind environment.<br>Comparison: CHRONIC WIND ADAPTATION - Gradual flagging over years. Stable adapted form. ACUTE WIND DAMAGE - Recent broken branches torn crown. Different situation requires intervention	none

Poplar host key.<br>Assessment: WHITE ROT progressive. STEM FAILURE mode. Shell thickness assessment critical. SLOW DISEASE often. May be monitored for years before critical.<br>Management: POPLAR CONTEXT - Short-lived trees anyway (60-100 years typically). Phellinus common on mature poplars. REMOVE if over targets and decay extensive. MONITOR if consequences low. Re-assess every 2-5 years. VETERAN POPLARS - Ancient black poplars with Phellinus may warrant retention. Ecological value high.<br>Similar species: PHELLINUS IGNIARIUS - On willow primarily. P. tremulae more poplar-specific. INONOTUS DRYADEUS - On oak. Exudes amber droplets. But different host. P. tremulae poplar host diagnostic.<br>Poplar ecology: Poplars relatively short-lived. Phellinus common on mature specimens. Part of natural senescence. Creates deadwood habitat. Veteran status if rare native black poplar involved.<br>Exudate feature: AMBER DROPLETS not always present. Depends on freshness of bracket and conditions. But DIAGNOSTIC when visible. Similar to Inonotus dryadeus exudate.<br>Field observation: Check poplars in riparian zones. Mature specimens often have Phellinus. White to brown appearance variable. Poplar host narrows identification	none

166	YES	Fungi	Declining horse chestnut with bleeding canker and alcohol smell suggests:	Armillaria only	Phytophthora plus bacterial infection (bleeding canker disease)	Normal aging	Mechanical damage	1	Horse chestnut bleeding canker is complex disease involving Phytophthora and Pseudomonas bacteria producing characteristic oozing lesions	Devastating disease of horse chestnut. Tarry bleeding. Distinctive alcohol/fermentation smell. Combination of pathogens. Progressive often fatal	Horse chestnut bleeding canker: PATHOGENS - COMPLEX. Phytophthora spp (oomycetes). Pseudomonas syringae pv. aesculi (bacteria). Often BOTH present. SYMPTOMS - BLEEDING CANKERS on trunk and branches. Dark rusty-brown to black tarry exudate. SMELL - Distinctive ALCOHOL or FERMENTATION odor. Characteristic. PROGRESSION - Lesions expand. May girdle stem. Crown thins yellowing leaves. Dieback progressive. Often fatal. SPREAD - Bacteria spread by rain splash insects. Phytophthora by water splash soil contact contaminated tools. HOST - Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) primarily. Also red horse chestnut and others. Impact: DEVASTATING to horse chestnut populations. Widespread UK since 2000s. Many mature specimens killed. Landscape character changing. PROGRESSIVE - Affected trees decline over years. Some survive but weakened. Many die. Assessment: BLEEDING CANKERS diagnostic. ALCOHOL SMELL confirms. CHECK EXTENT - How much of trunk affected? Is girdling occurring? CROWN CONDITION - Advanced dieback equals poor prognosis. PROGNOSIS - Variable. Some trees survive for years. Others die quickly. No reliable prediction. Management: NO CURE - Cannot treat effectively. BIOSECURITY - Clean tools. Avoid wounding trees. Minimize spread where possible. REMOVE - If dead or hazardous. Structurally compromised trees over targets. MONITOR - Regular inspection. Document progression. Safety assessment. REPLACEMENT - Consider alternative species. Horse chestnut high-risk for future planting in some areas. Prevention: AVOID WOUNDS - Minimize mechanical damage. Entry points for pathogens. TOOL HYGIENE - Disinfect between trees. SPECIES DIVERSITY - Don't rely solely on horse chestnut. Plant diverse species. Research: Ongoing investigation into disease mechanisms. Potential resistant cultivars being developed. No widespread solution yet. Combined stress: Horse chestnut ALSO affected by leaf miner (Cameraria). Combined stresses compound. Trees under multiple pressures decline faster. Recognition: BLEEDING TAR-LIKE CANKERS on HORSE CHESTNUT with ALCOHOL SMELL equals bleeding canker disease complex. Diagnostic combination	none	
167	YES	Defect	Sunken areas of bark with callus rolls and internal decay detected by resistograph indicates:	Surface injury only	Progressive internal decay following successful initial compartmentalization	Excellent structural integrity	Recent damage	1	Callused cankers show initial CODIT success but decay may continue internally despite external appearance of healing	External callus doesn't guarantee internal soundness. Tree compartmentalized surface but decay may have advanced internally before barriers fully effective	Canker-decay assessment: EXTERNAL APPEARANCE - Sunken bark necrosis. Callus rolls at edges. Appears to be healing. INTERNAL REALITY - Resistograph reveals decay behind/beneath canker. Internal advance despite surface compartmentalization. TIMELINE - Initial injury. Tree produces callus (visible healing). Meanwhile decay colonizes internally before barriers effective. Callus masks internal problem. CODIT LIMITATIONS - Barriers not always perfect. Decay may breach walls or establish before walls complete. Assessment approach: DON'T ASSUME healed canker equals sound wood. PROBE/TEST - Resistograph increment borer tomography. Check internal condition beneath callus. EXTENT - How deep is decay? Does it extend beyond visible canker? PROGRESSION - Is decay active or arrested? Test for soft wood vs hard compartmentalized wood. Management implications: CALLUSED CANKERS may mask significant internal decay. Cannot judge by external appearance alone. SHELL THICKNESS critical. If internal decay extensive despite good callus shell may be inadequate. FAILURE RISK depends on residual sound wood not external appearance. Quantify internal condition. Species variation: Some species better at internal compartmentalization. Oak generally excellent. Beech less reliable. Species-specific expectations matter. Visual vs actual: VISUAL - 'Looks good - nice callus healing well'. ACTUAL - Internal decay may be extensive. Testing reveals truth. Never judge by appearance alone with old cankers. Recognition: WELL-CALLUSED OLD CANKER doesn't equal STRUCTURALLY SOUND. Must test internally. Callus indicates successful SURFACE compartmentalization only. Assessment protocol: Identify old callused cankers. TEST INTERNALLY at those locations. Don't assume healed equals sound. Document findings. Compare external vs internal condition. Historic injuries: Trees with multiple old injuries may have extensive internal decay masked by callus. Cumulative weakening. Assessment must test all old injury sites	none	
168	YES	Pest	Processionary oak moth larvae moving nose-to-tail in long chains indicates:	Normal caterpillar behavior	Oak Processionary Moth infestation requiring immediate reporting	Harmless native species	Beneficial insects	1	Processionary behavior is characteristic of Oak Processionary Moth - larvae move in long nose-to-tail chains hence the name	Distinctive behavior diagnostic. Combined with white nests and oak host equals OPM. See Q97 and Q124 for full details on this notifiable hazardous pest	Oak Processionary Moth - Processionary behavior: DISTINCTIVE BEHAVIOR - Larvae move in LONG CHAINS nose-to-tail. Single file processions. Hence 'processionary' in name. PURPOSE - Travel between nest and feeding sites. Social species. Aggregation provides protection. RECOGNITION - If you see caterpillars in PROCESSION on OAK equals OPM. Highly characteristic. See Q97 for full details: TOXIC HAIRS - Urticating setae cause severe health problems. WHITE NESTS - Silken communal nests on trunk and branches. NOTIFIABLE - Legal requirement to report to DEFRA. DO NOT TOUCH - Professional treatment only. Public health hazard. Other features: HOST - Oak specific. TIMING - Visible May-July. Adults July-August. DISTRIBUTION UK - Established greater London area. Spreading. Management: REPORT IMMEDIATELY - Legal duty.

This question emphasizes the PROCESSIONARY BEHAVIOR specifically as diagnostic feature. See Q97 and Q124 for complete information on this critical pest	none	
169	YES	Biomech	A tree with extensive root decay but stable crown suggests failure will occur through:	Slow crown decline first	Sudden windthrow before obvious crown symptoms	Branch failure	Gradual improvement	1	Root decay compromises anchorage before vascular function - trees often retain healthy crowns until sudden windthrow occurs	Crown appearance misleading with root decay. Tree looks healthy until failure. Root plate assessment essential. See Q24 for related concepts	Root decay failure mode: ANCHORAGE vs VASCULAR - Root decay reduces anchorage first. Vascular transport may continue adequately through remaining roots. Crown appears healthy. SUDDEN FAILURE - Windthrow occurs with little or no crown warning. Tree looks fine then suddenly overturns. MISLEADING APPEARANCE - Healthy crown creates false sense of security. Internal root loss hidden. ASSESSMENT CRITICAL - Cannot judge stability from crown condition. Must probe root plate test stability. Fungi associated: MERIPILUS - Attacks roots. Crown healthy until failure. GANODERMA - Root and butt rot. Minimal crown symptoms initially. ARMILLARIA - Root rot. Sudden windthrow common. KRETZSCHMARIA - Brittle decay. May appear healthy then fail catastrophically. Warning signs (not crown): SOIL CRACKS radiating from base. Recent LEAN development. ASYMMETRIC SWAY in wind. Root plate ROCKING sensation. Fungal brackets at BASE. THESE indicate root problems despite healthy crown. Assessment protocol: PROBE ROOT PLATE - Steel rod around base. Check for movement looseness. EXCAVATION - Expose roots inspect integrity. PULLING TEST - Apply load measure root plate response. ASSUME POOR ANCHORAGE - If root decay fungi present assume compromise despite crown appearance. Management: ROOT DECAY with HEALTHY CROWN still equals HIGH RISK if significant decay present. REMOVE if over targets. Don't be reassured by good crown. MONITOR - If retained frequent stability assessment. EXPECT SUDDEN FAILURE - Windthrow mode. Little additional warning. Crown-root disconnect: CROWN CONDITION reflects vascular and photosynthetic function. ROOT CONDITION reflects mechanical anchorage. DIFFERENT SYSTEMS can fail independently. Crown good doesn't mean roots good. Critical concept: 'HEALTHY-LOOKING TREE SUDDEN FAILURE' scenario common with root decay. This is why root assessment essential. Cannot rely on crown evaluation alone. Species: All species vulnerable. Some fungi species-specific but principle applies broadly. Root decay equals windthrow risk regardless of crown appearance	none

Flat profile typically. G. AUSTRALE - Brown surface with zonate bands. Brown spores. More hoof-shaped. Both cause serious butt/root rot of oak. Assessment: SERIOUS ROOT DECAY. G. applanatum indicates extensive root plate compromise. WINDTHROW PRIMARY RISK. Stability assessment essential. BRACKET SIZE indicates minimum age of infection. Large bracket equals long-established decay. Management: ROOT PLATE ASSESSMENT critical. Probe excavate pulling test. REMOVAL often necessary especially over high-value targets. VETERAN OAK - Ancient oaks may have Ganoderma for decades. Balance ecology vs safety. Spore deposit: BROWN DUST very obvious. Covers bracket. Falls onto surfaces below. Stains brown. Diagnostic feature easily seen. Artist's bracket use: WHITE PORE SURFACE can be drawn on (scratches turn brown). Traditional use for nature artwork etchings. Interesting but don't encourage touching brackets on veteran trees. Ecological role: Part of oak aging process. Creates deadwood and cavities. Saproxylic habitat. In natural woodland part of succession. In managed landscape requires intervention if hazardous	none	
172	YES	Defect	Vertical crack with bark plates lifting away from wood indicates:	Minor surface damage	Bark separation from internal pressure or decay expansion	Normal growth	Recent successful treatment	1	Bark lifting proves underlying pressure forcing bark outward - indicates internal decay expansion or structural failure progressing	Intact bark adheres to wood.

Structural failure pushing outward. Loss of cambium adhesion. APPEARANCE - Bark plates loosened. Can be moved or are separated from wood. Gaps visible between bark and wood. EXTENT - Localized vs extensive. Percentage of circumference affected. ASSOCIATED FEATURES - Often with cracks. Sometimes with fungal growth beneath bark. Smell (decay). Causes: DECAY EXPANSION - Fungi producing gas. Decay volume increases. Pushes bark outward. STRUCTURAL FAILURE - Wood splitting internally. Forces bark plates apart. CAMBIUM DEATH - Dead cambium. Bark no longer attached. Sloughs off. Assessment: PROBE BENEATH BARK - What's under lifted bark? Decay? Cavities? Sound wood? EXTENT - How much bark affected? Percentage circumference? ASSOCIATED DECAY FUNGI - Look for mycelium beneath bark. Rhizomorphs. Sporophores. SMELL - Decay often has characteristic odor. Investigate. Management urgency: LIFTING BARK indicates INTERNAL PROBLEMS. Not just surface issue. INVESTIGATE THOROUGHLY - Resistograph tomography. Determine internal condition. SERIOUS if extensive or associated with structural cracks. May indicate imminent failure. Armillaria check: PEEL BARK carefully at lifted areas. Look for WHITE MYCELIAL FANS beneath (Armillaria diagnostic). Black RHIZOMORPHS on bark undersurface or in wood. If present assume serious root decay. Species variation: SOME SPECIES bark naturally exfoliates (plane sycamore birch). NORMAL shedding vs PATHOLOGICAL lifting. Context distinguishes. LIFTING associated with CRACKS and DECAY equals pathological. Concern. Natural exfoliation smooth and regular. Documentation: PHOTOGRAPH lifted bark areas. Document extent. PROBE and record findings beneath bark. Essential for risk assessment and tracking progression	none

176	YES	Defect	Fresh resin or gum exuding from bark cracks in conifers often indicates:	Excellent health	Stress response to injury disease or boring insects	Improved growth rate	Normal seasonal variation	1	Resinosis (excessive resin flow) is stress response to wounding disease bark beetle attack or other injuries in conifers	Conifers produce resin for defense. Excessive flow indicates active stress or injury. Investigate underlying cause	Resinosis in conifers: MECHANISM - Conifers produce resin in specialized ducts. Injury damage or pathogen attack triggers resin flow. Defense response attempting to seal wounds trap insects. APPEARANCE - Resin (pitch) oozing from bark. Fresh resin sticky clear or amber. Old resin crystallized white or brown. CAUSES - Bark beetle attack. Mechanical wounds. Fungal cankers. Environmental stress (drought extreme temperatures). Armillaria infection. Lightning. Assessment: LOCATE SOURCE - Where is resin flowing from? Wound? Crack? Boring hole? BARK BEETLES - Look for small entry holes. Bore dust (frass). D-shaped exit holes. Gallery patterns under bark. CANKERS - Sunken lesions. Bark death. Fungal signs. MECHANICAL DAMAGE - Impact wounds. Construction damage. ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS - Crown condition. Dieback. Overall vigor. Bark beetle connection: DEFENSIVE RESPONSE - Tree produces resin to trap boring beetles. Heavy resin flow (pitch tubes) indicates beetle attack. OVERWHELMING - If beetle population high or tree stressed defenses overcome. Beetles succeed despite resin. SPECIES - Various bark beetles attack conifers. Species-specific to host. Management: IDENTIFY CAUSE - Must determine why resinosis occurring. BARK BEETLES - If present assess extent. Consider control if early. Often too late once extensive. STRESSED TREES - Address stressors if possible. Irrigation thinning. Maintain vigor. MONITOR - Track progression. Crown condition. Beetle spread. REMOVE - Heavily infested dying trees. Reduce beetle population. Species variation: PINE - Produces copious resin. Pitch pockets pitch tubes common. SPRUCE FIR - Less resin. Woodpecker damage may show resin spots (feeding on beetles). LARCH - Deciduous conifer. Resin production. Normal vs pathological: NORMAL RESIN - Minor amounts at old wounds scars. Not concerning. PATHOLOGICAL - Extensive fresh resin flow. Multiple locations. Associated with decline. Investigate urgently. Prognosis: DEPENDS ON CAUSE - Single mechanical wound may heal. Bark beetle infestation may be fatal. Assess individually. STRESSED CONIFERS with extensive resinosis often in decline. Poor prognosis. Documentation: Note location extent color (fresh vs old). Photograph. Probe bark for beetles galleries. Essential for diagnosis	none	
177	YES	Biomech	Trees with included bark unions fail primarily in:	Compression	Tension	Torsion	All modes equally	1	Included bark creates slip plane with no tensile strength - unions fail when tension forces exceed friction at bark interface	Bark cannot bond. Tension pulls stems apart. No wood connection means no tensile resistance. See Q60 for detailed mechanics	Included bark failure mode: TENSION LOADING - Wind loading places tension stress on union. Attempts to pull stems apart. BARK INTERFACE - No wood-to-wood connection. Only bark-to-bark contact. NO BOND. RESISTANCE - Only friction and compression hold stems together. No tensile strength. FAILURE - Tension forces exceed friction. Stems separate along bark plane. Clean split. Why tension: BENDING - Wind causes stems to sway. Union experiences tension on leeward side. LEVERAGE - Heavy stems create high forces. Union must resist pulling apart. INCLUDED BARK - Provides zero tensile resistance. Friction insufficient. Failure occurs. Other loading modes: COMPRESSION - Bark can resist compression somewhat. Less critical. TORSION - Also problematic with included bark (see Q129). But TENSION is primary failure mode for included bark unions. SHEAR - Component of failure but tension dominant. Assessment focus: CHECK FOR MOVEMENT - Can stems move apart slightly? Indicates inadequate tensile resistance. CRACKS ON TENSION SIDE - Indicate tensile failure initiating. LOADING - Heavy crowns wind exposure increase tension forces. Prevention: STRUCTURAL PRUNING - Remove co-dominant stems early. Establish hierarchy. REDUCE ONE STEM - If union exists reduce subordinate. Lessens tension loading. Management: INCLUDED BARK unions are WEAK IN TENSION. Cannot rely on them under loading. CABLING above union limits tension but doesn't eliminate weakness. REMOVAL often necessary if high-value targets below. Recognition in assessment: NARROW V-SHAPED union with BARK VISIBLE in crevice equals included bark. Will fail in TENSION under sufficient loading. Plan accordingly. Engineering: Bark has NO TENSILE STRENGTH in this application. Wood-to-wood bond essential for tension resistance. Included bark eliminates bond. Union fundamentally weak	none

Larvae feed on fungus not wood. Black staining from fungal growth diagnostic. ENTRY HOLES - Small round 2-3mm. Often multiple holes. Frass (boring dust) may be present. IMPACT - Indicates tree stressed or declining. Galleries weaken wood locally but beetle is symptom not primary cause of decline. LIFECYCLE - Adults bore into sapwood. Create gallery system. Introduce fungus spores. Lay eggs. Larvae develop feeding on cultivated fungus. Adults emerge. Assessment: PRESENCE indicates STRESSED OAK. Investigate underlying causes - drought construction damage root problems disease. NOT PRIMARY KILLER but opportunistic on declining trees. AESTHETIC DAMAGE - Stained zigzag galleries visible in wood. Reduces timber quality. STRUCTURAL - Extensive galleries reduce strength locally. Usually not critical unless very heavy infestation. Management: TREE HEALTH - Address underlying stresses. Beetle is symptom. STRESSED OAKS more vulnerable. Maintain vigor where possible. NO DIRECT CONTROL practical. Insecticides rarely warranted. REMOVE - If tree dead or dying and hazardous. Otherwise tolerate. Natural part of oak decline. TIMBER USE - Affected wood has staining. Reduces value for clean timber. May be acceptable for other uses. Recognition: ZIGZAG M or W GALLERIES in OAK with BLACK STAINING equals oak pinhole borer. Pattern diagnostic. Different from: OAK BARK BEETLE - Galleries under bark not in wood. Different patterns (radial from central chamber). Smaller beetles. LONGHORN BEETLES - Larger galleries irregular paths. No zigzag letter patterns. Ecological role: Part of oak deadwood succession. Breaks down dead and dying oak. Ambrosia fungus cultivation fascinating biology. Saproxylic community member. Field observation: Look at cross-sections of dead oak. Zigzag galleries often visible. Black staining distinctive. Educational value for showing gallery patterns	none

TOPIARY - Takes clipping well. Common hedge and topiary plant. POISONOUS - Historically known. Kept away from livestock. Gender: DIOECIOUS - Male and female flowers on separate trees. Only female trees produce red arils. Male trees have small brown pollen cones. No true cones: Yew is conifer but produces fleshy ARIL not woody cone. Single seed surrounded by red cup. Birds eat arils disperse seeds (seed passes through undamaged). Warning: POISONOUS - Critical information. All parts except aril flesh deadly. Taxine alkaloids. Cardiac arrest. Never consume. Keep away from livestock horses especially sensitive	none	
180	YES	Defect	Multiple old pruning wounds with extensive decay columns radiating from each cut indicates:	Excellent pruning practice	Historic poor pruning allowing repeated decay entry	Recent storm damage	Natural senescence	1	Poor pruning creates large wounds that allow decay entry - multiple bad cuts over years create multiple decay columns weakening structure	Flush cuts improper technique remove branch collars. Large wounds invite decay. Multiple wounds over time create honeycomb of decay columns. Cumulative serious weakening	Historic poor pruning assessment: MULTIPLE WOUNDS - Numerous old pruning cuts visible. Large flush cuts. Stub cuts. Poor technique evidence. DECAY COLUMNS - Each wound has associated decay column. Wedge-shaped or irregular internal decay. CUMULATIVE EFFECT - Multiple decay columns. Cross-section shows honeycomb pattern. Extensive internal weakening. TIMEFRAME - Cuts made years or decades ago. Decay established and advancing. NOW see consequences of historical poor practice. Poor pruning practices: FLUSH CUTS - Cut into trunk removing branch collar. Damages trunk tissue. Large wound slow to close. Decay entry easy. STUB CUTS - Leaving long stubs. Stubs die back. Decay enters. Eventually affects trunk when stub connection decays. TOPPING - Indiscriminate heading cuts. Multiple large wounds. Severe decay risk. WRONG TIMING - Cutting during high-spore periods. Increased infection risk. NO RESPECT FOR CODIT - Damaging branch collars removes tree's protective barrier zones. Assessment: LOCATE ALL WOUNDS - Survey tree for old cuts. MAP DECAY - Test each wound location. Resistograph increment borer. Determine decay extent at each. CUMULATIVE - How much of cross-section affected? Multiple columns may overlap or leave inadequate sound wood. FAILURE RISK - Multiple weak zones. Tree may fail at any weakened location. Management challenges: ESTABLISHED DECAY cannot be reversed. Damage done. OPTIONS LIMITED - Reduce loading if possible. Monitor progression. Accept higher risk or remove. PREVENTION - Proper pruning from the start essential. Cannot fix poor historical work. Proper pruning contrast: TARGET PRUNING - Just outside branch collar. Preserves protective tissue. Wound closes efficiently. Decay minimized. PROPER TIMING - Appropriate season for species. RESPECT TREE BIOLOGY - Allow natural defense systems to work. Education value: Trees with multiple old flush cuts show long-term consequences. Teaching examples. Demonstrate importance of proper technique. Species variation: STRONG COMPARTMENTALIZERS (oak) may contain decay despite poor cuts. WEAK COMPARTMENTALIZERS (beech willow poplar) decay spreads readily. Poor pruning more damaging on weak species. Documentation: Photograph all old wounds. Document decay extent. Shows history of poor management. Useful for explaining current condition and risk. Legal: Historic poor pruning may have been industry standard at time. Current knowledge better.

183	YES	Defect	Stem with crack that opens and closes with wind loading (measurable movement) indicates:	Stable old injury	Active progressive failure requiring immediate intervention	Surface damage only	Normal flexing	1	Measurable crack movement proves active failure in progress - crack opening and closing with each loading cycle drives progressive propagation	Each cycle advances crack. Fatigue weakens surrounding wood. Imminent complete failure likely. Emergency situation. See Q157 for related concepts	Active crack movement: MEASUREMENT - Install crack gauges or marks. Observe during wind. Crack gap INCREASES under load. DECREASES when load removed. MOVEMENT - Measurable opening/closing (millimeters). Not just theoretical. VISIBLE MOVEMENT. PROGRESSIVE FAILURE - Each cycle causes microscopic damage. Fatigue accumulates. Crack advances. TIMELINE UNPREDICTABLE - May fail next wind event. Or after hundreds of cycles. Cannot predict. Must assume imminent. Why movement is critical: STATIC CRACKS may be stable if well-compartmentalized and not extending. MOVING CRACKS are ACTIVE FAILURES. Forces exceed material capacity. Continued propagation certain. FATIGUE - Repeated loading cycles weaken wood surrounding crack. Failure accelerates. Assessment urgency: MOVING CRACK equals EMERGENCY. IMMEDIATE BARRIERS - Exclude all targets from fall zone. No delay. SPECIALIST URGENT ASSESSMENT - Structural specialist immediately. DO NOT WAIT - Cannot predict final failure. May occur any time especially during wind. Movement measurement: SIMPLE - Mark crack edges. Measure gap. Re-measure during wind event. Gap increases proves movement. CRACK GAUGES - Commercial devices. Precise measurement. Document movement magnitude. VISUAL - Sometimes movement visible to eye during wind. Obvious flexing at crack. Management: IMMEDIATE REMOVAL typically only safe option. Cannot reliably stabilize active moving cracks. TEMPORARY SUPPORT - Propping during removal if necessary. Dangerous - failure possible during operations. NO LONG-TERM STABILIZATION - Moving cracks cannot be cabled or braced reliably. Must remove. Risk to workers: REMOVAL OPERATIONS hazardous. Tree may fail during work. Extra precautions. Rigging carefully. May require crane. Experienced personnel only. Weather consideration: DO NOT WAIT for calm weather to pass. Tree may fail during next wind. Urgent action regardless of weather. Documentation critical: Video or photos of movement. Measurements. Essential for demonstrating emergency nature. Legal defensibility if incident occurs. Contrast: STATIC CLOSED CRACKS - May be monitorable. MOVING OPEN/CLOSE CRACKS - Emergency. No delay acceptable.

185	YES	Biomech	The most critical time for wind damage to trees is when:	Leaves are off in winter	Soil is saturated and leaves fully expanded in summer storms	During spring growth	In autumn before leaf fall	1	Saturated soil reduces anchorage strength while full leaf canopy maximizes wind loading - combination creates highest windthrow risk	Summer storms after heavy rain are most dangerous. Soil loses shear strength. Roots cannot grip. Crown catches wind. Perfect conditions for windthrow. See Q169 related concepts	Critical windthrow conditions: SATURATED SOIL - Heavy rain saturates soil. Reduces soil shear strength dramatically. Roots cannot grip effectively. Anchorage compromised. FULL LEAF CANOPY - Summer foliage creates maximum wind resistance (sail area). Catches wind. High loading. COMBINATION - Saturated soil plus full canopy plus wind equals highest risk. All factors adverse simultaneously. Soil mechanics: DRY SOIL - Good shear strength. Particles bonded. Roots grip well. WET SOIL - Water fills pores. Reduces friction. Acts as lubricant. Shear strength drops 50%+ when saturated. ROOT SLIPPAGE - Roots pull through wet soil. Cannot anchor. Seasonal variation: WINTER STORMS - Leafless trees. Reduced sail area. Soil often wet but less canopy loading. Lower risk than summer. SUMMER STORMS - Full foliage. After prolonged rain. Soil saturated. HIGHEST RISK. SPRING - Partial foliage. Moderate risk. AUTUMN - Leaves present but soil usually drier. Moderate risk. SUMMER STORMS AFTER RAIN are worst scenario. Species vulnerability: DECIDUOUS - Full risk in summer. Leafless in winter safer. EVERGREEN - Risk year-round. Less seasonal variation. SHALLOW-ROOTED (birch spruce) - Very vulnerable saturated soils. DEEP-ROOTED less vulnerable but still affected. Risk factors compound: SATURATED SOIL plus FULL CANOPY plus STRONG WIND plus PREVIOUS ROOT DAMAGE plus DECAY equals extreme risk. Assessment timing: RISK ASSESSMENT before summer storm season. Identify vulnerable trees. PRE-EMPTIVE MANAGEMENT - Remove high-risk trees before storms. Cannot wait for event. POST-STORM INSPECTION - After major storms check all trees. New leans cracks soil disturbance. Warning signs: RECENT HEAVY RAIN - Soil visibly saturated. Standing water. CHECK WEATHER FORECAST - Storm predicted. Take pre-emptive action on vulnerable trees. RECENT WORK - Construction root damage soil compaction. Trees more vulnerable. Management: HIGH-RISK TREES before summer storms. Prioritize removal. BARRIERS during storm events. Close areas under vulnerable trees. INSPECTION after storms. Prompt assessment. Prevention: MAINTAIN SOIL STRUCTURE - Avoid compaction. Protect root zones. SPECIES SELECTION - Choose appropriate species for site. GRADUAL EXPOSURE - Don't suddenly expose sheltered trees. Historical events: Major storm events often occur summer. Saturated soil plus leaf-on conditions. Numerous trees fail. Documented pattern. Engineering: WORST CASE LOADING for design. Soil weakest plus canopy loading maximum. Must assess for this scenario. Why winter storms less damaging: LEAFLESS trees offer less wind resistance. Soil may be wet but loading reduced. Fewer failures typically despite strong winds. Key message: SUMMER STORMS after prolonged rain are MOST DANGEROUS time for windthrow. Assess vulnerability before storm season	none	
186	YES	Root	Soil heave on the opposite side of a leaning tree after storms indicates:	Stable root plate	Active root plate movement and anchorage failure	Normal seasonal swelling	Animal disturbance	1	Soil heave opposite the lean indicates roots lifting and failing under wind load	A raised soil mound opposite the direction of lean is a classic sign of root plate rotation. Anchorage failure is active and progressive. Immediate assessment required.	"Root plate mechanics: When wind loads a tree, roots on the windward side are compressed while leeward roots are pulled. If soil shear strength is exceeded, roots lift, causing visible soil heave. This is a primary windthrow indicator, especially in wet soils. High-risk condition requiring urgent intervention."	none	
187	YES	Root	Which soil condition most reduces tree anchorage strength?	Dry compacted clay	Well-drained loam	Saturated soil with reduced shear strength	Frozen ground	2	"Saturated soils lose shear strength, allowing roots to slide and pull out"	"Water-filled soil pores reduce friction between particles, dramatically weakening anchorage. Combined with wind, this creates high windthrow risk."	"Soil mechanics: Shear strength drops significantly when soil becomes saturated. Roots rely on soil friction for anchorage; when lost, even healthy roots can fail. This is why summer storms after heavy rain cause widespread windthrow."	none	
188	YES	Crown	Lion-tailing primarily increases failure risk by:	Reducing wind load	Concentrating weight at branch ends	Increasing photosynthesis	Improving structure	1	"Lion-tailing shifts mass to branch ends, increasing bending moments"	End-weight increases leverage forces on branches and unions. This raises stress and failure likelihood during wind loading.	"Crown biomechanics: Removing inner foliage shifts the centre of mass outward. Bending moments increase exponentially with distance from the stem. Lion-tailing also removes damping foliage, increasing oscillation. Poor practice."	none	
189	YES	Crown	Epicormic growth on a mature tree most commonly indicates:	Excellent vitality	Response to stress or loss of crown	Normal ageing only	Pest resistance	1	Epicormic shoots are stress responses to loss of photosynthetic area	"Epicormic growth often follows heavy pruning, storm damage, or decline. It is a survival response, not a sign of health."	Tree physiology: Dormant buds activate when carbohydrate balance is disrupted. Epicormic growth restores photosynthesis but is weakly attached and structurally inferior. Indicates prior stress.	none	
190	YES	Species	Beech (Fagus sylvatica) is known for:	Strong decay compartmentalisation	Weak compartmentalisation and rapid decay spread	Extreme wind firmness	Deep taproots	1	"Beech compartmentalises decay poorly, allowing rapid internal spread"	"Once decay enters beech, it often spreads extensively. Structural integrity can decline quickly despite sound external appearance."	CODIT context: Beech has limited ability to wall off decay (weak Walls 2 and 3). Hollowing progresses rapidly. Visual inspection alone is unreliable. Conservative assessment required.	none	
191	YES	Species	Willow trees often tolerate extensive hollowing because:	They have no decay fungi	They rely on thick adaptive outer shells	They regenerate heartwood rapidly	Hollows increase strength	1	"Willow adapts by thickening remaining sound wood, forming functional shells"	Many willows survive decades with hollow stems by maintaining sufficient shell thickness relative to diameter.	"Veteran tree mechanics: Structural integrity depends on shell thickness-to-radius ratio. Willows are adaptive growers, but failure risk increases if shell becomes too thin or crown weight excessive."	none	
192	YES	CODIT	The primary purpose of CODIT is to explain:	Why fungi attack trees	How trees defend against decay spread	Tree biomechanics	Tree growth rates	1	CODIT describes how trees compartmentalise damage and decay	"CODIT explains biological defense, not healing. Trees isolate damage; they do not repair it."	CODIT (Compartmentalisation Of Decay In Trees) describes barrier formation (Walls 1–4). Effectiveness varies by species and wound size. Core arboricultural concept.	none	
193	YES	CODIT	Flush cuts are problematic because they:	Look untidy	Increase wind loading	Remove the branch collar and breach defensive barriers	Slow growth	2	"Flush cuts remove the branch collar, compromising CODIT defenses"	"This allows decay to enter the stem directly, bypassing natural protective zones."	"Proper pruning respects the branch collar. Flush cuts damage Wall 4, the strongest defensive barrier, allowing decay to spread into trunk wood."	none	
194	YES	Root	Recent excavation within a tree’s rooting zone most increases risk of:	Fungal fruiting	Crown dieback	Delayed root failure and instability	Improved drainage	2	Root damage often leads to delayed instability rather than immediate symptoms	Trees may appear stable for months or years before failing once damaged roots decay or loads increase.	"Construction damage: Root severance reduces anchorage and uptake. Failure is often delayed, making this a hidden high-risk factor in assessments."	none	
195	YES	Crown	Asymmetric crown development most often results from:	Random growth	Poor genetics	Prevailing wind or light direction	Disease only	2	Crowns adapt toward light and away from wind exposure	Crown asymmetry alters load distribution and must be considered in risk assessments.	"Biomechanics: Uneven mass creates torsional and bending stresses. Trees adapt but may become vulnerable if conditions change suddenly (e.g., shelter removal)."	none	
196	YES	Target	A hazardous tree in woodland differs from one in a town because:	Woodland trees are stronger	Targets are fewer or absent	Risk does not apply in woodland	Decay behaves differently	1	"Risk depends on likelihood of harm, which includes target presence"	"A defective tree with no targets may be acceptable, while the same tree in a town is not."	Risk = hazard × target × consequence. Target occupancy and vulnerability are fundamental to proportionate decision-making.	none	
197	YES	Target	A moving playground beneath a defective tree increases risk primarily by:	Increasing decay	Increasing occupancy and exposure	Changing tree biology	Improving monitoring	1	More frequent target presence increases likelihood of harm	Risk rises even if the tree condition remains unchanged.	Risk is dynamic. Changes in site use can elevate risk without any change in the tree itself. Assessments must consider land-use changes.	none	
198	YES	Environment	Drought stress most commonly predisposes trees to:	Wind firmness	Pest and pathogen attack	Improved rooting	Increased leaf size	1	Stressed trees are more vulnerable to pests and diseases	"Drought weakens defense systems, making trees susceptible to secondary agents."	"Tree stress physiology: Reduced carbohydrate reserves impair defense. Many pests (e.g., borers) preferentially attack stressed hosts."	none	
199	YES	Environment	Flooding stress primarily affects trees by:	Improving nutrient uptake	Causing root oxygen deprivation	Increasing leaf size	Strengthening anchorage	1	"Waterlogged soils deprive roots of oxygen, causing root death"	Root loss leads to decline and instability even after floodwaters recede.	Anaerobic conditions kill fine roots. Recovery varies by species. Post-flood assessments should consider delayed decline and failure.	none	
200	YES	Biomech	Sudden removal of surrounding trees most increases failure risk due to:	Improved light exposure	Loss of shelter and wind buffering	Increased photosynthesis	Reduced competition	1	Sudden exposure increases wind loading beyond adaptive capacity	Trees acclimated to sheltered conditions may fail when suddenly exposed.	Adaptive growth: Trees develop wood strength relative to experienced loading. Sudden exposure exceeds design limits. Known as edge effect or windfirmness loss.	none	
201	YES	Root	Soil heave and cracking on the leeward side of a tree after storms most strongly indicates:	Normal seasonal shrinkage	Root plate movement and partial uprooting	Fungal decay of roots	Bark dehydration	1	"Soil cracking and lifting indicate the root plate is rotating under wind load, a precursor to windthrow"	"Soil heave assessment: Root plate rotation causes compression on windward side and tension cracking on leeward side.

"Mechanism: Wind loading causes root plate rotation - windward roots compressed, leeward roots lifted. Soil cracks open on tension side.<br>Assessment signs: Linear cracks radiating from base, soil mounding/heaving, exposed root plate edges, recent lean development.<br>Conditions: Most common after saturated soil + strong winds. Wet soil has reduced shear strength - roots slip through substrate.<br>Severity indicators: Crack width, extent of heave, degree of lean, whether movement is progressive.<br>Management: Immediate exclusion zone.

Often non-recoverable - removal typically required.<br>Timing: Usually occurs during or immediately after storm events, especially summer storms with full canopy and wet soil"	none	
202	YES	Root	Trees growing in compacted urban soils are most likely to fail due to:	Increased stem strength	Poor anchorage and reduced root spread	Excessive crown density	Fungal infection only	1	"Compaction limits root development and oxygen, reducing anchorage strength"	"Compacted soils reduce pore space, oxygen, and root penetration. Roots remain shallow and plate-like, increasing windthrow risk. Often combined with drought stress and poor vitality."	"Soil compaction effects: Reduces pore space, eliminates macropores, prevents oxygen diffusion to roots. Bulk density >1.6 g/cm³ severely limits root growth.<br>Root response: Shallow plate-like root systems, limited lateral spread, poor depth penetration. Roots confined to surface layers.<br>Mechanical consequence: Inadequate anchorage. Root plate too small/shallow to resist wind loading. Windthrow primary failure mode.<br>Combined stresses: Compaction + drought = severe stress. Limited root volume cannot access water during dry periods.<br>Construction damage: Compaction often occurs during development - vehicle traffic, material storage, excavation backfill.<br>Assessment: Soil penetrometer testing, root collar excavation to assess root architecture. Check for shallow restricted root systems.<br>Species vulnerability: Shallow-rooted species (birch, spruce) most affected. Deep-rooted species struggle but fare slightly better"	none	
203	YES	Crown	Lion-tailing primarily increases risk of:	Reduced wind loading	Increased end-weight and branch failure	Improved structure	Reduced epicormic growth	1	"Removing inner foliage shifts weight to branch ends, increasing leverage"	"Lion-tailing concentrates mass at branch tips, increasing bending moments and failure risk. Also reduces damping and increases stress at unions."	"Biomechanics: Removing inner foliage shifts centre of mass outward. Bending moment increases exponentially with distance from fulcrum.<br>Leverage effect: End-weight creates excessive stress at branch unions and along branch length. Torque = force × distance.<br>Loss of damping: Inner foliage absorbs wind energy and dampens oscillation. Removal increases branch movement amplitude.<br>Failure modes: Branch snap at weak points, failure at unions, torsional stress at junctions.<br>Poor practice origin: Outdated aesthetic preference misunderstood as 'cleaning' or 'lifting'. Creates hazardous structure.<br>Crown response: May trigger epicormic growth along bare sections - weakly attached, adding future problems.<br>Comparison: Natural crown retains inner foliage providing structural support and energy absorption.<br>Recognition: Long bare branches with foliage tufts at ends. Lacks natural taper and distribution"	none	
204	YES	Crown	Epicormic growth along the main stem most often indicates:	Excellent vitality	Stress response to injury or loss of crown	Normal seasonal growth	Advanced root decay only	1	Epicormic shoots are a compensatory response to stress or crown loss	"Epicormic growth is triggered when stored energy is redirected after pruning, damage, or decline. Indicates stress, not vigour."	"Trigger mechanism: Dormant buds activated when carbohydrate balance disrupted. Crown loss reduces photosynthetic area, stored energy redirected.<br>Causes: Severe pruning, storm damage, crown dieback, defoliation by pests/disease, root damage affecting crown.<br>Appearance: Clusters of shoots from trunk or main branches, often below point of damage/pruning.<br>Structural weakness: Epicormic shoots poorly attached, lacking proper branch collar development. Prone to failure as they mature.<br>Indicator of stress: Presence signals prior trauma, not vitality. Tree attempting to restore photosynthetic capacity.<br>Species variation: Some species (oak, lime) readily produce epicormic growth. Others (beech, birch) less so.<br>Management: Often removed but indicates underlying problem requiring investigation. Address root cause.<br>Long-term: If retained, epicormic shoots add weight and future maintenance burden. Weak attachment = future hazard"	none	
205	YES	Species	Beech (Fagus sylvatica) is considered structurally vulnerable because it:	Compartmentalises decay strongly	Has brittle wood and weak compartmentalisation	Has deep taproots	Rarely develops decay	1	Beech is a weak compartmentaliser and prone to brittle failure	"Beech struggles to contain decay, allowing rapid internal spread. Combined with brittle wood, this increases sudden failure risk, especially in mature trees."	"Compartmentalisation weakness: Beech has weak CODIT Walls 2 and 3. Cannot effectively block radial or tangential decay spread.<br>Decay progression: Hollowing progresses rapidly once established. Internal decay extensive before external signs obvious.<br>Wood characteristics: Brittle fracture properties. Fails suddenly under load - snaps rather than bends or shows progressive failure.<br>Common fungi: Kretzschmaria deusta, Ganoderma spp., Meripilus. All cause extensive decay in beech.<br>Assessment challenge: External appearance misleading. Sound-looking beech may be extensively hollow. Testing essential.<br>Failure mode: Sudden catastrophic failure - stem snap or branch failure with little warning.<br>Management implications: Conservative assessment required. Assume decay more extensive than visible signs suggest.<br>Species comparison: Oak compartmentalises well. Beech opposite end of spectrum. Species-specific expectations critical"	none	
206	YES	Species	Which species is MOST tolerant of extensive hollowing while remaining standing?	Birch	Willow	Spruce	Cherry	1	Willow can tolerate large hollows due to adaptive growth and flexibility	"Willow forms adaptive growth around decay, maintaining functional shells. Hollowing is common in veteran willows and not automatically hazardous."	"Adaptive growth: Willows respond to stress/decay by forming reaction wood around affected areas. Maintains functional shell.<br>Hollow tolerance: Large central hollows common in veteran willows. Shell thickness-to-radius ratio critical, not absolute hollow size.<br>Flexibility: Willow wood flexible, not brittle. Bends under load rather than snapping. Reduces sudden failure risk.<br>Assessment approach: Measure remaining shell thickness. Calculate t/R ratio (shell thickness/radius). Generally safe if >0.3.<br>Pollarded willows: Traditional management creates hollow bollings over centuries. Part of natural life cycle.<br>Failure mode: When failure occurs, usually progressive - leaning, cracking, gradual rather than catastrophic.<br>Ecological value: Hollow veteran willows are biodiversity hotspots. Rare saproxylic invertebrates depend on these habitats.<br>Species note: Applies to native willows (Salix spp.). Crack willow, white willow, pollards most relevant"	none	
207	YES	CODIT	The primary purpose of the branch collar is to:	Strengthen the branch	Produce leaves	Act as a defence zone against decay entry	Store water	2	The branch collar contains defence tissues that limit decay spread	CODIT relies on preserving natural defence zones. Cutting through the branch collar removes protective barriers and increases decay risk.	"Branch collar function: Contains chemical and physical barriers (Wall 4 of CODIT). High concentration of defensive compounds.<br>Barrier zone: Branch collar tissues compartmentalise branch from trunk. Natural protection preventing decay spread to main stem.<br>Location: Swollen area at branch base where branch tissue meets trunk tissue. Visible as raised collar or wrinkle.<br>Target pruning: Cut just outside branch collar, preserving protective zone. Maintains tree's natural defence architecture.<br>Wound response: Proper collar preservation allows efficient wound closure and compartmentalisation.<br>Species variation: Collar prominence varies. Some species (oak) have obvious collars. Others (beech) more subtle.<br>Historical practice: Flush cuts were once standard. Current understanding of CODIT changed best practice fundamentally.<br>Long-term effect: Proper pruning = minimal decay. Flush cuts = extensive decay columns developing over decades"	none	
208	YES	CODIT	Flush cuts increase decay risk because they:	Leave too much branch material	Remove protective barrier tissues	Dry too quickly	Encourage epicormic growth	1	Flush cuts remove the branch collar and compromise natural defences	"Removing the collar allows decay to enter trunk tissues directly, overwhelming compartmentalisation."	"Flush cut damage: Removes branch collar entirely, cutting into trunk wood. Exposes trunk tissues lacking branch defences.<br>CODIT Wall 4: Branch collar is Wall 4 - the strongest barrier. Flush cuts remove it completely.<br>Decay entry: Fungi colonise exposed trunk wood directly. No protection zone remains. Decay spreads into trunk tissues.<br>Wound size: Flush cuts create larger wounds than target cuts. More surface area exposed, slower closure.<br>Long-term consequence: Decay columns extend into trunk following grain. Can hollow out trunk over time.<br>Visual deception: May callus over externally appearing 'healed' but internal decay progresses beneath callus tissue.<br>Assessment of old flush cuts: Test internally with resistograph or tomography. Don't assume healed appearance = sound wood.<br>Prevention: Always preserve branch collar. Target cuts just outside collar line. Respect tree biology"	none	
209	YES	Target	A tree with significant decay but no targets beneath it is best described as:	High risk	Low risk despite high hazard	Unacceptable	Illegal to retain	1	Risk is a function of hazard AND target presence	"Risk assessment combines likelihood of failure with consequences. No target = low risk, even if hazard is high."	"Risk formula: Risk = Hazard × Target × Consequence. All three components required for risk.<br>Hazard without target: Tree may have high failure likelihood (hazard) but if nothing/no one is present (target), risk is low.<br>Proportionate management: Resources allocated based on risk, not hazard alone. Low-risk situations may not require intervention.<br>Legal/duty of care: Reasonable management considers both tree condition AND target presence. Context matters.<br>Example: Decayed tree in remote woodland = low risk. Same tree over car park = high risk. Tree unchanged, risk differs.<br>Documentation: Record both hazard assessment AND target evaluation. Justify decisions based on risk, not hazard alone.<br>Dynamic risk: Risk changes if site use changes. Tree unchanged but new playground installed = risk increased.<br>Communication: Explain to clients/public that 'dangerous tree' depends on location and what's beneath it"	none	
210	YES	Target	A frequently occupied playground beneath a tree increases risk primarily because of:	Tree species	Soil type	Target occupancy	Fungal presence	2	High occupancy increases consequences even if likelihood is unchanged	Risk increases with target exposure. Occupancy is a key risk multiplier independent of tree condition.	"Target occupancy definition: Frequency and duration people/property are present beneath tree. Measured in exposure time.<br>Consequence multiplier: High occupancy = higher consequence if failure occurs. More people = greater potential harm.<br>Examples: Playground (constant occupancy) vs. woodland path (occasional) vs. remote area (rare).<br>Risk calculation: Same tree hazard, different target occupancy = different risk levels. Proportionate response required.<br>Assessment factors: Time of day, seasonal use, number of people, age/vulnerability of users (children vs. adults).<br>Management decisions: High-occupancy targets justify more intervention. Low occupancy may allow retention with monitoring.<br>Mitigation: Can reduce risk by managing target (barriers, path relocation) instead of only tree removal.<br>Legal duty: Higher duty of care where occupancy is high, especially vulnerable users (schools, playgrounds, care facilities)"	none	
211	YES	Environment	Prolonged drought most commonly causes which root response?	Deeper rooting	Fine root mortality	Increased anchorage	Improved nutrient uptake	1	Drought kills fine absorbing roots first	"Fine roots are most sensitive to drought, reducing water uptake and predisposing trees to pests and decay."	"Mechanism: Drought reduces soil moisture below wilting point. Fine feeder roots desiccate and die first - most sensitive tissues.<br>Consequences: Reduced water/nutrient uptake, predisposition to pests and disease, reduced growth, crown thinning.<br>Recovery: Dead fine roots do not regenerate immediately. Recovery lag of 1-2 years even after rain returns.<br>Secondary effects: Trees weakened by root loss vulnerable to bark beetles, Armillaria, other opportunistic pathogens.<br>Species variation: Shallow-rooted species (birch, beech, spruce) most vulnerable. Deep-rooted species (oak, some pines) more tolerant.<br>Urban context: Street trees and compacted soils limit root volume - drought stress more severe. Combined stresses compound.<br>Assessment indicators: Crown thinning, leaf scorch, premature autumn color, dieback, reduced growth rings.<br>Management: Irrigation during drought (if practical), mulching to retain moisture, reduce competition, avoid additional stresses"	none	
212	YES	Environment	Flood-intolerant species planted in waterlogged soils typically show:	Increased growth	Root suffocation and decline	Improved stability	No visible symptoms	1	Oxygen deprivation in saturated soils damages roots	"Waterlogging reduces oxygen availability, causing root death, reduced uptake, and increased instability."	"Anaerobic conditions: Waterlogged soil lacks oxygen. Fine roots require oxygen for respiration - suffocation occurs.<br>Root death: Anaerobic metabolism produces toxic compounds (ethanol, acetaldehyde). Root cells die.<br>Species tolerance: Flood-intolerant species lack adaptations (aerenchyma, adventitious roots). Roots die quickly.<br>Visible symptoms: Crown thinning, yellowing foliage, dieback, premature leaf drop. Symptoms often delayed (weeks to months).<br>Secondary infections: Dead/dying roots vulnerable to Phytophthora, Armillaria, other root pathogens. Compounding problems.<br>Stability loss: Root death reduces anchorage. Windthrow risk increases even if crown appears acceptable.<br>Recovery: Depends on duration of flooding and species. Prolonged saturation = poor prognosis.<br>Assessment: Post-flood inspection essential. Assume root damage even if crown looks acceptable initially. Monitor for delayed decline"	none	
213	YES	Root	A tree leaning suddenly after storms with cracked soil but no stem defects most likely indicates:	Stem failure	Root anchorage failure	Crown imbalance only	Normal movement	1	Sudden lean with soil disturbance indicates root plate failure	Root failure often precedes stem failure. Soil symptoms are key early indicators.	"Immediate signs: New lean development, soil cracks radiating from base, exposed roots, soil heave/mounding on one side.<br>Failure mechanism: Root plate rotates under wind load. Leeward roots lift, windward roots compress. Soil mechanical failure.<br>Contrast stem failure: No stem cracks/splits. Trunk intact. Problem is below ground at root-soil interface.<br>Soil conditions: Often occurs after saturated soil + wind. Wet soil has reduced shear strength. Roots pull through substrate.<br>Assessment: Probe root plate with steel rod - check for movement/looseness. Look for asymmetric lean, soil disturbance.<br>Urgency: Root plate movement is progressive. Each wind event causes additional damage. High-priority intervention.<br>Management: Usually non-recoverable. Exclusion zone immediately. Removal typically required - re-anchorage rarely successful.<br>Prevention: Protect root zones from compaction/damage. Maintain soil structure. Recognize vulnerable trees before failure"	none	
214	YES	Crown	Asymmetric crowns are most hazardous when combined with:	Calm conditions	Shelter from wind	Prevailing wind exposure and decay	Winter dormancy	2	Uneven loading plus decay increases failure likelihood	"Asymmetric crowns shift load unevenly. Combined with decay or weak unions, failure risk increases significantly."	"Loading dynamics: Asymmetric crown creates uneven weight distribution. Centre of mass displaced from stem centreline.<br>Bending moments: Off-centre mass produces higher bending stress on one side of stem. Unevenly loaded unions stressed.<br>Wind interaction: Prevailing wind from one direction compounds asymmetry. Constant loading in same direction.<br>Decay combination: If decay present on tension side of lean or at stressed union, failure risk multiplies.<br>Failure modes: Stem failure at point of high stress, union failure where asymmetry concentrates loading, root plate failure from uneven loading.<br>Assessment: Identify direction of lean/asymmetry. Check prevailing wind direction. Test for decay at high-stress zones.<br>Species variation: Brittle species (beech, horse chestnut) less able to compensate. Flexible species (willow, poplar) more tolerant.<br>Management: Reduce asymmetry if possible (pruning to balance). Remove if decay + asymmetry + targets present. Monitor stress zones"	none	
215	YES	Environment	Urban heat island effects most commonly lead to:	Reduced transpiration	Increased drought stress	Improved tree health	Reduced pest pressure	1	Higher temperatures increase water demand and stress	"Urban heat raises evapotranspiration, increasing drought stress and vulnerability to pests and decline."	"Urban heat island: Impervious surfaces, lack of vegetation, heat-absorbing materials increase urban temperatures 2-5°C above rural areas.<br>Physiological effect: Higher temperatures increase transpiration rate. Water demand rises. Trees under greater water stress.<br>Drought stress: Urban heat + limited soil volume + compaction = severe drought stress. Combined factors compound.<br>Secondary effects: Heat-stressed trees vulnerable to pests (borers, scale insects), diseases (Armillaria, Phytophthora), decline.<br>Species selection: Choose heat/drought-tolerant species for urban environments. Mediterranean species often suitable.<br>Mitigation: Increase canopy cover (reduces heat island), permeable surfaces, adequate soil volume, irrigation where practical.<br>Assessment: Urban trees under chronic stress. Expect reduced lifespan, increased pest/disease pressure, higher management needs.<br>Climate change: Heat island effects intensifying. Future urban forestry must account for increasing heat stress"	none
