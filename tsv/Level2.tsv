1	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Mature beech, 18m height, DBH 72cm, located in municipal park. Grey hoof-shaped perennial brackets visible at 1.2m height on north aspect of stem. Resistograph testing at bracket location shows 8cm shell thickness with radius measured at 36cm. Crown density assessed at 65% with minor dieback evident in upper crown. Tree overhangs children's play area with constant use 9am-5pm daily weekdays and weekends. Recent storms with 60mph winds caused no visible damage to tree or surrounding trees. What is the MOST appropriate management recommendation?	Install immediate exclusion barrier and commission emergency removal within 7 days	Remove tree during next scheduled maintenance window within 6 months with area closure	Reduce crown by 30% to decrease loading and monitor quarterly with continued use	Accept current risk level and continue annual monitoring as tree shows no recent deterioration	0	Grey hoof-shaped perennial bracket on beech indicates Fomes fomentarius causing white rot. Shell thickness ratio t/R = 8/36 = 0.22 is critically below safe threshold of 0.30	High-consequence target (children's playground with constant occupancy) combined with inadequate shell thickness creates unacceptable risk that requires immediate intervention regardless of recent performance	FUNGUS IDENTIFICATION:<br>Grey hoof-shaped perennial bracket on beech equals Fomes fomentarius. This fungus causes progressive white rot of stem, reducing structural integrity over years to decades.<br><br>STRUCTURAL CALCULATION:<br>Shell thickness (t) = 8cm<br>Radius (R) = 36cm<br>t/R ratio = 8 ÷ 36 = 0.22<br><br>Critical threshold: 0.30 minimum required<br>This tree at 0.22 is significantly below safe threshold.<br><br>RISK ASSESSMENT:<br>LIKELIHOOD: High (inadequate shell thickness, progressive decay)<br>CONSEQUENCE: Extreme (children constantly present, potential serious injury/death)<br>OVERALL RISK: Extreme (high × extreme = unacceptable)<br><br>DECISION RATIONALE:<br>Despite no recent storm damage, the combination of inadequate structural capacity and extreme consequence targets means failure could occur at any time. Crown reduction would not address fundamental shell inadequacy. Six-month delay unacceptable given extreme consequences. Immediate barriers protect public while removal organized.

2	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Oak, 25m height, DBH 95cm, located near car park. Six brackets visible at various heights: 2× Ganoderma brackets at base (30cm diameter), 1× Inonotus dryadeus at root collar showing amber droplets, 3× small brackets at 8m height on main stem. Root plate excavation reveals 40% of structural roots with soft fibrous white rot decay. No soil cracks visible around base. Crown assessed at 80% density with healthy vigorous appearance. Tree 12m from car park edge, vehicles park beneath crown daily. What is the PRIMARY risk concern and appropriate timeframe for action?	Stem decay at 8m height requires crown reduction within 3 months to reduce leverage	Root and butt decay indicates windthrow risk requiring removal within 4 weeks	Multiple fungi indicate systemic infection requiring immediate emergency felling	Crown appears healthy therefore tree is stable and can be monitored annually	1	Inonotus dryadeus at root collar combined with 40% structural root decay indicates serious anchorage compromise. Root decay creates windthrow risk before crown symptoms appear	Root plate failure is the primary concern when decay affects anchorage system. Healthy crown appearance is misleading - roots fail before vascular function compromised. Prompt action required given target exposure	FUNGUS IDENTIFICATION:<br>• Ganoderma at base: Root and butt rot (white rot)<br>• Inonotus dryadeus: Root collar decay (amber droplets diagnostic)<br>• Small brackets at height: Secondary concern compared to root issues<br><br>PRIMARY RISK ANALYSIS:<br>ROOT DECAY: 40% of structural roots affected = major anchorage loss<br>FAILURE MODE: Windthrow most likely (roots compromised, stem may be sound)<br>CROWN CONDITION: Misleading indicator - healthy crown does NOT mean stable roots<br><br>WHY CROWN LOOKS HEALTHY:<br>Remaining 60% of roots still transport water/nutrients adequately. Vascular function maintained while structural anchorage failing. Crown decline appears AFTER roots already critically compromised.<br><br>TIMEFRAME JUSTIFICATION:<br>No soil cracks YET, but 40% root loss is critical threshold. Next significant wind event could cause failure. 4 weeks allows organized removal while recognizing urgency. Not imminent (hours/days) but cannot wait months.<br><br>TARGET ASSESSMENT:<br>Car park = high consequence (occupied vehicles, people accessing cars daily). Windthrow could cause serious injury and property damage.		Integrates: Inonotus dryadeus (L1-Q138), Ganoderma root rot (L1-Q5), root decay vs crown condition (L1-Q169), risk timeframes (L1-Q46)
3	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Sweet chestnut veteran, 20m height, DBH 110cm, located in estate grounds. Extensive basal cavity present with opening measuring 80cm × 60cm. Interior wood is hard, dark, and well-compartmentalized with well-callused edges around opening. Three fresh Fistulina hepatica brackets (beefsteak fungus) appeared this autumn at cavity margins, actively bleeding red juice when touched. Shell thickness measurements: North 18cm, East 22cm, South 15cm, West 20cm. Tree has long-established lean of 8° to south with visible buttressing on tension side. Located in low-use area of estate grounds, nearest path 40m away. Calculate structural adequacy and determine appropriate management.	Shell thickness critically inadequate requiring immediate removal regardless of veteran status	Adequate shell thickness on three sides, reduce crown on south side and monitor	Veteran tree with adapted lean and adequate overall shell - retain with annual monitoring	Install ground anchors and cable system to stabilize lean and prevent progression	2	Thinnest shell (south side 15cm, radius ~55cm) gives t/R = 15/55 = 0.27. While below ideal 0.30, veteran tree with adapted lean, buttressing, low targets, and compartmentalized decay is acceptable risk	Veteran trees merit higher risk tolerance when targets allow. Adapted lean with buttressing shows successful long-term stability. Fistulina causes brown rot but cavity well-compartmentalized. Balance ecology and heritage against marginal structural adequacy	STRUCTURAL CALCULATIONS:<br>Assume DBH 110cm means radius approximately 55cm at cavity height<br><br>Shell thickness ratios (t/R):<br>• North: 18/55 = 0.33 ✓ (adequate)<br>• East: 22/55 = 0.40 ✓ (good)<br>• South: 15/55 = 0.27 ✗ (marginal)<br>• West: 20/55 = 0.36 ✓ (adequate)<br><br>CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:<br>South side at 0.27 is below ideal 0.30 threshold BUT context matters:<br><br>POSITIVE FACTORS:<br>• Long-established 8° lean (not recent) with visible buttressing = adapted<br>• Cavity edges well-callused = successful compartmentalization<br>• Hard dark interior = inactive decay, not progressing<br>• Three of four aspects have adequate shell<br>• Low consequence targets (40m to nearest path)<br><br>FISTULINA HEPATICA:<br>Fresh brackets indicate active colonization BUT Fistulina causes slow brown rot. Fresh fruiting doesn't mean rapid structural decline imminent. Species relatively slow-acting compared to Armillaria or Kretzschmaria.<br><br>VETERAN TREE CONSIDERATIONS:<br>Sweet chestnut veteran has high ecological and heritage value. Risk tolerance appropriately higher when consequences are low. Tree showing successful adaptation (buttressing, callus, stable lean).<br><br>DECISION RATIONALE:<br>Marginal shell thickness (0.27) would normally require intervention, but veteran status + low targets + evidence of adaptation + compartmentalized decay = acceptable risk with monitoring. Annual inspections to check for lean progression, crack development, or shell thinning.

4	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Pollarded willow beside public footpath, bolling height 2.5m, diameter 85cm. Twelve poles average 4m length regrown from last cutting 8 years ago. Five Phellinus igniarius brackets (grey-black, hoof-shaped, 15-25cm) present on bolling. Cavity probe shows hollow center with shell thickness varying 8-12cm. Poles show healthy vigorous growth with no decay. Tree beside public footpath with moderate pedestrian use, 15m from nearest residential property. Historical photos from 10 years ago show similar condition with brackets already present. Local community values tree as landmark. What factors determine whether this veteran pollard should be retained or removed?	Hollow center with thin shell requires immediate removal regardless of other factors	Phellinus indicates active decay requiring removal within 6 months before progression	Veteran pollard with stable long-term decay, adequate shell, and low targets - retain with phased pole reduction	Remove bolling, replant new willow, and re-establish pollard cycle for long-term sustainability	2	Shell thickness 8-12cm on bolling radius ~42cm gives t/R = 0.19-0.29. Below ideal but veteran pollards often survive decades with marginal ratios. Phellinus slow-progressing, condition stable for 10+ years, targets moderate	Veteran pollards have cultural and ecological value. Balance structural risk against heritage. Phased reduction of heavy poles reduces loading on marginal shell while retaining veteran. Management preserves tree while addressing structural concerns	STRUCTURAL ASSESSMENT:<br>Bolling diameter 85cm = radius ~42cm<br>Shell thickness 8-12cm variable<br>t/R ratios = 8/42 to 12/42 = 0.19 to 0.29<br><br>Thinnest at 0.19 is concerning, thickest at 0.29 nearly adequate. Variable shell means bolling has weak zones.<br><br>DECAY ASSESSMENT:<br>Phellinus igniarius on willow = white rot, slow progression. Historical photos show brackets present 10+ years ago = decay long-established but NOT rapidly progressing. Tree has survived with this decay for over a decade.<br><br>LOADING ANALYSIS:<br>12 poles × 4m length × estimated 15-20kg per pole = significant weight (180-240kg total) on hollow bolling. Heavy regrowth creates bending moment. Reducing pole number and length decreases loading on marginal shell.<br><br>VETERAN POLLARD VALUE:<br>• Cultural heritage: Traditional pollard management, local landmark<br>• Ecological: Hollow bollings = rare saproxylic habitat (beetles, bats)<br>• Historical continuity: Tree likely 100+ years old<br><br>RISK vs VALUE:<br>Footpath = moderate consequence (pedestrian injury possible but not constant high occupancy like playground). 15m from property = windthrow unlikely to reach building. Marginal risk acceptable given veteran status.<br><br>MANAGEMENT APPROACH:<br>Phased pole reduction over 2-3 years:<br>• Remove 4 poles first year<br>• Remove 4 poles second year<br>• Retain 4 poles permanently (reduced length)<br>Gradual reduction avoids shock to ancient tree, reduces loading incrementally, maintains some canopy for tree health.

5	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Ash tree, 15m height, DBH 45cm, showing ash dieback symptoms (50% crown dieback, diamond-shaped lesions on stem bark). Kretzschmaria deusta present at base with grey powdery patches developing into black crusty stromata covering lower 1.5m of stem. Resistograph testing shows brittle ceramic-like decay extending through lower 2m of stem. Tree located 6m from main road, overhangs pavement with moderate pedestrian traffic. Owner requests retention for screening purposes and notes tree provides nesting birds habitat. What is the MOST significant risk factor and appropriate response?	Ash dieback is primary concern - crown reduction will extend tree life while maintaining screening	Kretzschmaria causing brittle basal decay is most critical - creates imminent snap failure risk requiring urgent removal	Combined diseases indicate terminal decline - monitor quarterly and remove when crown reaches 70% dieback	Install prop to support stem at 2m height, allowing retention for screening while managing brittleness	1	Kretzschmaria deusta causes uniquely brittle ceramic-like decay with minimal warning before catastrophic failure. Combined with ash dieback stress, tree has both reduced structural capacity and increased loading vulnerability. Basal brittleness is most critical factor	Ash dieback affects many trees, but Kretzschmaria brittleness is specifically dangerous. Sudden snap failure mode means no warning. Moderate pedestrian target plus road traffic creates unacceptable risk. Screening and habitat value cannot override safety with brittle basal decay	DISEASE INTERACTION:<br>ASH DIEBACK (Hymenoscyphus fraxineus):<br>• 50% crown dieback = advanced stage<br>• Diamond lesions = vascular blockage<br>• Tree stressed, declining, vulnerable to secondary pathogens<br><br>KRETZSCHMARIA DEUSTA:<br>• Grey→black progression = active colonization<br>• Soft rot causing BRITTLE CERAMIC fracture<br>• Most dangerous decay fungus - sudden failure<br>• Minimal external symptoms until very late<br>• Lower 2m affected = basal snap zone<br><br>WHY KRETZSCHMARIA IS MOST CRITICAL:<br>Ash dieback alone: Tree declines over years, crown reduces, may survive decade+ in diminished state. Manageable risk if monitored.<br><br>Kretzschmaria alone: Even healthy-crowned tree with this decay is extreme risk due to brittleness.<br><br>COMBINED: Ash dieback stress + Kretzschmaria brittleness = worst case scenario. Stressed tree cannot compartmentalize, decay progresses faster, brittleness creates unpredictable failure.<br><br>FAILURE MODE:<br>Basal snap without warning. Brittle fracture means stem snaps suddenly like breaking pottery. No progressive cracking or leaning warning. Entire crown (even 50% dieback crown weighs several tonnes) falls onto pavement/road.<br><br>TARGET ASSESSMENT:<br>6m from main road = fall zone includes road and pavement. Moderate pedestrian traffic + vehicle traffic = high consequence if failure occurs. Timing unpredictable with Kretzschmaria.<br><br>SCREENING VALUE vs SAFETY:<br>Owner's desire for screening does not override pedestrian/traffic safety. Nesting birds can be accommodated by timing removal outside breeding season (remove October-February), but removal is necessary.

6	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Horse chestnut, 22m height, DBH 78cm, located in school grounds. Bleeding canker lesions with tarry exudate and distinctive alcohol smell cover 60% of trunk circumference at 1-3m height. Crown thinning to 40% density with small leaves and premature autumn color evident. Extensive Cameraria leaf miner damage visible. Tree 12m from school building, moderate use area (not playground but students pass during breaks). Previous inspection 18 months ago noted canker extent at 30% circumference. Assess progression rate and determine management priority.	Rapid progression (30% to 60% in 18 months) indicates terminal decline - remove during next school holiday	Moderate progression but tree not yet girdled - monitor every 6 months and remove when 80% girdled	Combined stressors (canker, leaf miner, decline) indicate high risk - remove within 8 weeks before winter	Bleeding canker is treatable - injection treatments plus improved cultural care can reverse decline	0	Canker progression from 30% to 60% in 18 months (doubling in 1.5 years) indicates rapid girdling trajectory. At this rate, 100% girdling likely within 12-18 months. Combined with crown decline and leaf miner stress, tree in terminal decline phase	Horse chestnut bleeding canker has no cure. Rapid progression rate means tree approaching critical girdling (80-100% = certain death). Multiple stressors compound decline. School setting requires proactive removal before tree becomes hazardous dead standing stem	BLEEDING CANKER ASSESSMENT:<br>Pathogen: Phytophthora + Pseudomonas bacterial complex<br>Current extent: 60% circumference at 1-3m height<br>Previous extent: 30% (18 months ago)<br>Progression rate: 30% increase in 18 months = 20% per year<br><br>GIRDLING PREDICTION:<br>At 20% per year rate:<br>• Current: 60%<br>• 12 months: 80% (critical threshold)<br>• 18-24 months: 100% (complete girdling, certain death)<br><br>Critical girdling (80%+) means vascular transport blocked, crown death imminent, tree becomes standing deadwood hazard.<br><br>CROWN DECLINE INDICATORS:<br>• 40% density (severe thinning)<br>• Small leaves (stress response, limited resources)<br>• Premature autumn color (physiological stress)<br>• All indicate vascular dysfunction from canker girdling<br><br>CAMERARIA LEAF MINER:<br>Adds additional stress. Reduces photosynthetic capacity. Tree cannot produce energy to fight canker or maintain vigor. Multiple stressors compound - tree declining from all directions.<br><br>SCHOOL SETTING CONSIDERATIONS:<br>Not immediate emergency (not playground, moderate use) BUT school liability considerations require proactive management. Don't wait for complete girdling and standing dead hazard. Remove during school holiday minimizes disruption.<br><br>TREATMENT PROSPECTS:<br>No cure for bleeding canker. Phosphite injections may slow progression slightly but will not reverse 60% girdling. Cultural improvements (water, nutrients) cannot overcome systemic infection. Removal is only realistic option.

7	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Veteran oak, 28m height, DBH 140cm, estimated 350+ years old, located in historic parkland. Multiple fungi present: Fistulina hepatica at base, Inonotus dryadeus at root collar, Laetiporus sulphureus at 6m height causing visible delamination on scaffold branch. Tomography mapping shows 35% sound wood remaining, distributed asymmetrically with thicker shell on north/east, thinner on south/west. Tree 50m from nearest structure, in open parkland grazed by sheep. Notable veteran status with rare saproxylic beetles recorded (violet click beetle, noble chafer). Local conservation group campaigns for retention. How should ecological value be balanced against structural risk?	Ecological value irrelevant when structural capacity inadequate - remove immediately	Retain tree accepting high risk due to irreplaceable veteran status and distant targets - annual monitoring only	Install exclusion fencing at 30m radius to eliminate livestock targets, retain tree for ecology, monitor bi-annually	Reduce crown by 40% to decrease loading, fence at 20m radius, intensive quarterly monitoring	2	35% sound wood with asymmetric distribution creates structural concern, but 50m from structures significantly reduces consequence. Veteran oak with rare protected species has high conservation value. Fencing eliminates livestock targets, allowing acceptance of higher structural risk	Veteran trees with rare saproxylic species are irreplaceable in human timescales (350+ years). Risk assessment must weigh rare ecology against actual consequences. Distant targets allow tolerance of marginal structure. Fencing provides practical risk reduction	FUNGAL DECAY ASSESSMENT:<br>FISTULINA HEPATICA (beefsteak fungus):<br>• Base location, brown rot, relatively slow progression<br>• Causes internal decay but less aggressive than some fungi<br><br>INONOTUS DRYADEUS:<br>• Root collar location, amber droplets diagnostic<br>• White rot of roots, windthrow risk primary concern<br>• Serious anchorage implications<br><br>LAETIPORUS SULPHUREUS:<br>• 6m height on scaffold branch, brown rot with delamination<br>• Branch failure risk but not whole-tree windthrow<br><br>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:<br>35% sound wood remaining means 65% affected by decay. This is extensive. However, distribution matters: thicker shell on north/east may be on compression side if prevailing wind from south/west, providing more resistance where needed.<br><br>RISK ASSESSMENT:<br>LIKELIHOOD: Moderate to high (extensive decay, multiple fungi, root and stem affected)<br>CONSEQUENCE without mitigation: Moderate (sheep grazing = livestock injury possible, property 50m away unlikely to be impacted even if tree fails)<br>CONSEQUENCE with fencing: Low (30m exclusion removes livestock from impact zone, property still safe at 50m)<br><br>VETERAN TREE VALUE:<br>• 350+ years old = irreplaceable, cannot be recreated in human lifespan<br>• Rare protected species present (violet click beetle, noble chafer) = national conservation importance<br>• Deadwood and decay features took centuries to develop<br>• Loss would be permanent ecological damage<br><br>MANAGEMENT RATIONALE:<br>Fencing at 30m creates safety buffer, removes livestock targets. Tree retained for rare species. Bi-annual monitoring detects any rapid deterioration (lean changes, crack development). Crown reduction avoided - would remove habitat and stress ancient tree further.

8	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Lime avenue tree, 16m height, DBH 55cm, urban street setting. Extensive Kretzschmaria deusta black stromata covering 270° of stem circumference on lower 1.5m. Resistograph indicates brittle decay extending 25cm into stem. Crown appears healthy with 75% density. Tree is one of 40 in formal avenue planted 1880, high amenity and historic value. Adjacent to busy A-road with constant traffic, outdoor café seating beneath crown during summer months. Footfall 500+ pedestrians daily. What assessment protocol is required to determine retention viability?	Visual assessment confirms Kretzschmaria - no additional testing needed, remove based on fungus identification alone	Tomography at multiple heights to map full decay extent, plus detailed loading calculations for risk quantification	Pulling test to assess stability plus crown reduction to decrease loading, allowing retention with mitigation	Monitor quarterly for crack development - if no cracks appear within 6 months, tree can be retained long-term	1	Kretzschmaria causes ceramic-like brittle decay with sudden failure. In high-consequence setting (constant traffic, pedestrians, café), detailed quantification needed to determine if any shell remains adequate. Tomography maps extent at multiple heights, calculations determine if retention possible	High-value setting (avenue historic value, amenity) justifies detailed assessment before removal decision, but extreme consequences (hundreds daily exposure) require rigorous structural proof if considering retention.

9	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Beech, 24m height, DBH 88cm, parkland setting. Meripilus giganteus rosette (1.2m diameter total) at base with characteristic brown bruising when touched. Root plate inspection via air-spade excavation reveals extensive white rot in 3 of 4 major structural roots (north, east, south sectors affected). West sector roots appear sound with firm wood. Soil cracks (3mm width) radiate 2m from base on north side only. Tree overhangs occupied residential building 8m away. Last Meripilus fruiting body noted 3 years ago (smaller, 40cm). What stability assessment methods should be employed before determining action?	Visual observation of soil cracks confirms instability - no further testing needed, remove within 48 hours	Pulling test to quantify root plate movement, plus tomography of root collar to map decay extent	Excavate all four root sectors to full depth, assess each individually, calculate remaining anchorage capacity	Install inclinometers for 6 months to measure progressive lean before deciding on removal	1	Soil cracks indicate movement occurring, but extent unclear. Pulling test quantifies how much root plate tilts under known load, revealing if failure imminent or moderate. Tomography maps root collar decay extent. Both provide evidence for retention vs removal decision	Root decay requires direct stability testing, not just visual assessment. Pulling test is gold standard for anchorage evaluation. Tomography shows if root collar (critical junction) has adequate sound tissue. Combined evidence determines if removal urgent or if monitoring possible	MERIPILUS ASSESSMENT:<br>• Meripilus giganteus = white rot fungus specific to roots and root plate<br>• Rosette form with brown bruising diagnostic<br>• Fruiting body size increase (40cm→120cm over 3 years) suggests decay progression<br>• Affects structural roots, creates windthrow risk<br><br>ROOT DECAY DISTRIBUTION:<br>3 of 4 major roots affected (75%) = severe anchorage loss.

10	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: Sycamore, 19m height, DBH 65cm, located in park. Ganoderma australe bracket (hoof-shaped, zonate brown surface, 18cm diameter) at root collar on south side. Tomography at bracket height shows 180° of cross-section (south semicircle) with moderate decay (orange/yellow on tomogram), remaining 180° (north semicircle) sound wood (blue/green on tomogram). Heavy brown spore deposit visible on ground below bracket. Tree 25m from playground, 30m from main footpath. Crown 70% density with some minor dieback in upper crown. Does bracket location and decay distribution affect failure mode prediction?	Asymmetric decay creates torsional loading - tree will twist and fail in spiral pattern	South-side decay means tree most likely to fail southward during south wind loading (decay on compression side)	South-side decay means tree most likely to fail northward during south wind loading (decay on tension side under bending)	Decay distribution irrelevant - root rot causes windthrow in unpredictable direction regardless of decay location	2	Under south wind loading, north side goes into tension (stretching), south side into compression. Decay on south (compression side) may be tolerated better than if on tension side. However, tension side failures more common when shell weakened. Tree may fail northward if south wind overpowers compromised compression zone	Decay location relative to prevailing wind direction affects failure prediction. Bending mechanics put tension on windward side, compression on leeward. Failure typically initiates on tension side (crack propagation), but decay on compression side can cause crushing collapse. Both scenarios possible	GANODERMA AUSTRALE IDENTIFICATION:<br>• Hoof-shaped, zonate brown surface = G. australe characteristic<br>• Root collar location = root and butt rot<br>• Brown spore deposit confirms Ganoderma genus<br>• White rot of roots and lower stem<br><br>DECAY DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS:<br>Tomography shows:<br>• South 180° = moderate decay (not severe, but compromised)<br>• North 180° = sound wood<br>• Asymmetric pattern with clear decay on one side only<br><br>BENDING MECHANICS:<br>When wind loads from SOUTH:<br>• South side = COMPRESSION (being squeezed)<br>• North side = TENSION (being stretched)<br>• Maximum stress at outer fibers on both sides<br><br>FAILURE MODE SCENARIOS:<br><br>SCENARIO A (More likely): South wind → North side in tension → If north side sound but south side weak, may fail as compression zone collapses → Tree falls NORTHWARD<br><br>SCENARIO B: South wind → North side in tension → North side sound, resists tension → South compression zone with decay crushes → Tree fails NORTHWARD<br><br>SCENARIO C: North wind → South side in tension → South side weakened by decay → Crack initiates on south tension side → Tree fails SOUTHWARD (toward playground at 25m)<br><br>PREVAILING WIND CONSIDERATION:<br>UK prevailing wind typically SW. If this site has SW prevailing wind, most loading events push tree NE (away from playground). However, occasional north winds would push tree toward playground (south).<br><br>RISK ASSESSMENT:<br>Most likely failure direction: Northward (away from playground). But cannot exclude southward failure during north wind. 25m distance to playground = margin of safety if tree 19m tall, but large crown could extend fall radius.<br><br>MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS:<br>Decay distribution suggests slightly lower risk to playground than if decay were on north side. However, this is marginal consideration. Primary factors remain: extent of decay (50% of cross-section), root collar location (windthrow risk), and proximity to targets.

What management approach addresses both current and potential future risk?	Remove Oak A immediately, leave Oak B and monitor - it may have resistance	Remove both trees immediately - Oak B infection probable even if asymptomatic	Remove Oak A immediately, trench between trees to sever root connections and prevent spread to Oak B	Monitor both trees quarterly - only remove if Oak B shows symptoms or Oak A deteriorates further	0	Oak A confirmed infected, will decline and become hazardous. Oak B likely already infected via root contact (Armillaria spreads root-to-root) but symptoms lag years behind infection. Remove Oak A promptly (declining, hazardous). Monitor Oak B closely but trenching won't prevent spread already occurred	Armillaria spreads underground before symptoms visible. By the time Oak A shows symptoms, Oak B likely colonized years ago. Trenching ineffective if infection already present. Remove known hazard (Oak A), monitor Oak B for inevitable symptoms over 3-5 years	ARMILLARIA INFECTION DYNAMICS:<br><br>OAK A - CONFIRMED INFECTION:<br>• Rhizomorphs in soil = active spread mechanism<br>• White mycelial fans under bark = DIAGNOSTIC (gold standard for Armillaria identification)<br>• Crown thinning 45% = advanced infection, vascular disruption<br>• Prognosis: Decline inevitable, will become dead standing hazard within 2-5 years<br><br>OAK B - SUSPECTED INFECTION:<br>• Currently asymptomatic (85% crown density appears healthy)<br>• Trees 8m apart = roots almost certainly in contact<br>• Armillaria spreads via root-to-root contact and rhizomorphs<br>• Timeline: Infection spreads underground for 3-5 years BEFORE crown symptoms appear<br>• High probability Oak B already infected but pre-symptomatic<br><br>SITE INFECTION HISTORY:<br>3 oak deaths within 30m over 5 years = established Armillaria infestation in soil.

Bark loose and easily removed, crown severely thinned to 25% density, epicormic sprouting visible on lower stem. Tree assessed as dead or nearly dead. Located in woodland 80m from nearest path, no infrastructure nearby. Area managed for biodiversity with documented rare saproxylic beetles present in deadwood. Tree will fall naturally within 2-5 years. Should this tree be removed or retained, and what factors support the decision?	Remove immediately - dead standing trees are always hazards regardless of location	Remove within 6 months - British legal duty of care requires eliminating hazards even in remote woodland	Retain tree as standing deadwood for biodiversity - location and site management justify acceptance	Reduce height to 8m (habitat pole) to decrease windthrow risk while retaining some deadwood value	2	Tree is dead/dying but 80m from path (beyond fall distance even accounting for crown spread). No targets in fall zone. Site managed for biodiversity, rare beetles present. Standing deadwood has high ecological value. Risk is negligible given distance	Woodland management for biodiversity can accept natural tree mortality. Standing deadwood ecologically valuable (beetles, fungi, birds). Legal duty of care applies to foreseeable harm - no credible target means no actionable risk.

Weather forecast shows 50mph winds arriving in 7 days. Develop work prioritization schedule considering urgency, resources, and weather timeline.	Work on critical trees only - complete all 8 in 5 days, accept remaining risks until after storm	Address critical and high priority - complete 8 critical plus 10 high priority in 5 days, leave 5 high and 22 moderate	Distribute effort equally - work on trees from all three categories to reduce overall risk across park	Focus on quick wins - remove all 22 moderate priority trees (easier) rather than 8 difficult critical trees	1	8 critical trees require immediate attention (imminent failure + high targets). Climbers can complete ~2 trees per day × 2 climbers × 5 days = 20 trees possible. Prioritize all 8 critical + as many high priority as possible. 50mph storm makes urgent work critical	Storm forecast creates deadline. Critical trees over high-consequence targets (playgrounds, buildings) are non-negotiable priorities. High priority trees (probable failure) also need attention before storm.

14	YES	Biomech	SCENARIO: Oak with included bark union (co-dominant stems, 58cm and 62cm diameter at union, 28° angle). Support cable installed 3m above union 5 years ago (8 tonne breaking strain). Union shows 8cm crack visible at base. Recent storm with 55mph winds - cable held, union did not fail. Tree located over garden, moderate use area. Cable inspection shows no damage, hardware sound. Does cable presence reduce failure likelihood sufficiently to justify retention, or does crack progression indicate cable delaying inevitable failure?	Cable successfully prevented failure during storm - tree safe to retain with annual cable inspections	Crack presence despite cable indicates progressive failure - cable only delays inevitable failure, remove tree within 3 months	Cable reduces likelihood from high to moderate - acceptable risk for garden setting, continue retention with bi-annual monitoring	Re-cable with stronger system (12 tonne) and reduce both stems by 30% to decrease loading on union	3	Cable limits movement but does NOT fix fundamental weakness (included bark, no wood connection). Crack formation shows progressive failure despite cable. Cable delayed failure but doesn't eliminate it. Crack will continue propagating. Garden setting has moderate consequence, but continuing retention with crack progression is high risk	Cables are mitigation, not cure. Support cables limit movement but cannot address lack of structural connection. Crack formation proves union is failing despite cable. Question is timing of failure, not if failure will occur. Garden over high-value targets might accept risk, but residential garden with crack progression suggests removal appropriate	INCLUDED BARK UNION MECHANICS:<br>• 58cm and 62cm stems = nearly co-dominant (1:1 ratio)<br>• 28° angle = narrow V-shaped union<br>• Included bark = NO wood-to-wood connection<br>• Only friction and compression hold stems together<br>• Fundamentally weak structure<br><br>CABLE FUNCTION AND LIMITATIONS:<br><br>WHAT CABLES DO:<br>• Limit movement between stems (reduce differential flexing)<br>• Share loading between stems<br>• Reduce stress at union by restricting relative motion<br><br>WHAT CABLES DO NOT DO:<br>• Create structural connection (bark still prevents wood bonding)<br>• Eliminate tensile stress at union<br>• Prevent crack propagation indefinitely<br>• Fix underlying weakness<br><br>CRACK SIGNIFICANCE:<br>8cm crack at union base = tensile failure initiating<br>Crack formed DESPITE cable presence = forces exceeded cable's ability to completely prevent stress<br>Crack will propagate with continued loading cycles (wind, snow, ice)<br>Progressive failure in motion<br><br>STORM PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:<br>55mph winds, cable held = cable functioned as designed<br>Union did not fail = cable successfully limited movement enough to prevent catastrophic failure<br>BUT crack formed/extended = partial failure occurred, union weakening progressively<br><br>FAILURE PREDICTION:<br>Without cable: Union would have failed during 55mph storm<br>With cable current state: Union will eventually fail as crack propagates (timeline uncertain - could be next major storm or several years)<br>With stronger cable + reduction: Would reduce rate of crack propagation but NOT eliminate progressive failure<br><br>MANAGEMENT OPTIONS:<br><br>OPTION A (Retain with monitoring):<br>Crack suggests progressive failure, but over garden (not playground/building) = moderate consequence<br>Cable inspection annually ensures hardware sound<br>Bi-annual tree inspection monitors crack progression<br>Acceptable risk IF homeowner understands progressive nature and accepts possible future failure into garden<br><br>OPTION B (Remove within 3 months):<br>Conservative approach - recognizes crack means failure timeline uncertain<br>Appropriate if garden has high-value features (greenhouse, vehicles, frequent use areas)<br><br>OPTION C (Upgrade cable + reduce):<br>Expensive (£2000+ for re-cabling + reduction)<br>Delays failure but doesn't prevent<br>Only justified if tree has exceptional value<br><br>RECOMMENDED: Option A (retain with monitoring) for moderate-consequence garden setting.

Measured at narrowest point: North side shell 14cm, South side shell 22cm, East side shell 18cm, West side shell 16cm. Crown asymmetric with 60% of crown mass on south side. Wind exposure from south-west (prevailing wind direction). Calculate t/R ratios for each aspect and determine which side represents greatest failure risk considering crown asymmetry and wind direction.	North side thinnest shell (t/R = 0.29) represents greatest risk regardless of loading direction	South side greatest risk - crown mass asymmetry creates maximum stress despite thicker shell	North side greatest risk - thinnest shell plus SW wind places north in tension under prevailing loads	East side greatest risk - intermediate shell thickness combined with oblique wind loading creates torsion	2	External diameter 96cm gives radius 48cm. North shell t/R = 14/48 = 0.29 (marginal). SW wind places north in tension (maximum stress on thinnest shell). Crown mass on south adds compression south side, but tension on north is critical failure mode. North side represents greatest risk	Tension failures more common than compression failures. Thinnest shell on tension side under prevailing wind creates highest failure probability. Crown asymmetry compounds issue by shifting center of mass, increasing bending moment.

Internal decay mapping shows 70% of stem cross-section affected at worst location (4m height). Tree has long-established lean of 15° over river (away from footpath on bank side). Lean shows buttressing response, indicating adaptation. River bank erosion exposing some roots on river side. Footpath on opposite side 8m from tree with moderate pedestrian use. Does lean direction away from targets affect risk assessment and management decision?	Lean direction irrelevant - 70% decay requires removal regardless of lean orientation	Lean away from footpath significantly reduces risk - retain tree with annual monitoring	Lean toward river increases windthrow likelihood - remove before bank erosion causes failure	Install ground anchors on bank side to prevent river-ward lean progression	1	Lean of 15° toward river (away from footpath) means failure would direct tree into water, not toward pedestrian targets. 70% decay is severe but directional bias reduces consequence.

Cubical brown rot decay evident in affected dead tissue areas. Live crown in upper 12m appears healthy with good needle density, normal color, and annual growth increment within normal range. Dead lower branches result from natural shade-induced senescence and self-pruning with age. Tree in woodland setting with no targets or infrastructure nearby. Is intervention required for brown rot fungi on deadwood portions while live crown remains healthy?	Brown rot in stem requires immediate removal before decay progresses to live crown	Remove dead lower branches to eliminate fungus and prevent upward spread	Monitor tree quarterly - remove if decay enters living wood or crown condition declines	No intervention needed - saprophytic colonization of dead tissue, live crown healthy, no targets	3	Fomitopsis colonizes dead wood (saprophytic on pine deadwood). Brown rot affects only dead branches/lower dead stem, not progressing into live crown. Tree healthy above, no targets present.

20	YES	Fungi	SCENARIO: London plane, 25m height, DBH 95cm, urban street tree. Large Ganoderma applanatum bracket at base (40cm diameter, flat shelf-like form, heavy brown spore deposits accumulating on pavement requiring frequent cleaning). Root plate beneath paving, unable to excavate for inspection. Tomography shows 60% decay in visible root flare area. Crown 75% density with healthy appearance. Tree located in busy shopping street with constant pedestrian traffic (500+ people daily), outdoor café seating directly beneath crown during summer months. How do urban constraints (paving, high targets, access limitations) affect assessment methodology and management options?	Visual assessment plus tomography sufficient - proceed with removal recommendation based on 60% decay	Cannot assess adequately due to paving - must remove tree as precautionary measure when assessment limited	Excavate paving around base to expose roots for full inspection before determining management	Accept higher uncertainty - use tomography, pulling test, and detailed loading calculations to determine retention viability	3	Urban constraints limit full root inspection, but sophisticated assessment tools (tomography, pulling test) can quantify risk. High consequences (constant occupancy) require evidence-based decision, not precautionary removal. Detailed analysis needed	Urban trees face unique assessment challenges (infrastructure, access limits, high targets). Professional must use available tools to maximum effect.

21	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Three trees require action with limited budget allowing immediate work on only one tree. Tree A: Large oak, extensive Ganoderma decay, overhangs busy playground with 100+ children daily, high likelihood failure + extreme consequence. Tree B: Beech with moderate decay, overhangs lawn area with minimal use, moderate likelihood failure + low consequence. Tree C: Ash with advanced dieback, dead standing in remote woodland 200m from any path, high likelihood failure + negligible consequence. Using risk matrix methodology, justify priority ranking.	Tree C highest priority - most likely to fail, address imminent hazard first regardless of location	Tree A highest priority - risk = likelihood × consequence, highest risk score justifies priority	Tree B moderate priority - balance of likelihood and consequence makes most cost-effective intervention	All three equal priority - hazardous trees should be addressed without prioritizing based on targets	1	Risk matrix: Tree A = High × Extreme = Extreme risk (highest). Tree B = Moderate × Low = Low risk. Tree C = High × Negligible = Low risk. Tree A priority: highest overall risk score, unacceptable risk level, consequence severity	Risk assessment must weigh both likelihood AND consequence.

22	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Oak, 24m height, DBH 92cm, with Inonotus dryadeus and root decay. t/R ratio calculated at 0.31 (marginally adequate). Pulling test shows 0.35° tilt at 8kN load (concerning but not critical threshold). Tree overhangs domestic garden used daily by homeowner, spending 3-4 hours there in summer. Tree provides significant amenity and privacy screening valued by homeowner. Removal cost £4,500, homeowner reluctant due to cost and loss of screening. How should risk tolerance be determined when consequences are significant but likelihood is moderate?	Marginal t/R and concerning pulling test require removal regardless of homeowner preference - safety overrides cost	Adequate t/R (>0.30) justifies retention - monitor annually and remove only if deterioration occurs	Balance risk against homeowner's use pattern and risk acceptance - intensive monitoring allows retention if homeowner informed	Install prop support system to eliminate risk mechanically, allowing indefinite retention	2	t/R 0.31 marginally adequate, pulling test concerning but not failed. Homeowner daily exposure = significant consequence but NOT extreme (vs. playground). Homeowner can accept informed risk. Quarterly monitoring detects deterioration.

23	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Veteran beech in park shows extensive decay (t/R 0.22, critically low) and recent lean increase of 12° toward main footpath over past 18 months. Path has average 50 users daily, peak 150+ on summer weekends. Path closure would require 400m detour. Tree has high ecological value with rare saproxylic beetles (violet click beetle) and veteran status. Strong public attachment with memorial plaque. What risk mitigation options exist between full removal and accepting current risk?	Remove tree immediately - t/R 0.22 unacceptable regardless of ecological value or public sentiment	Partial path diversion around wider exclusion zone (20m radius), retain tree with fencing, intensive monitoring	Crown reduction by 50% to decrease loading, allowing retention with annual monitoring	Accept current risk with warning signage - ecological value justifies higher risk tolerance	1	t/R 0.22 with recent lean progression indicates high failure risk. Full removal vs. accepting risk are false binary. Partial path diversion creates physical barrier (eliminates target exposure), allows retention for ecology. Balance safety and conservation	Risk mitigation requires creative solutions beyond remove/retain binary. Path diversion eliminates target exposure while preserving ecological value.

Limb shows brown rot decay at failure point. Wind forecast: 40mph gusts next 48 hours. Access requires main road closure for 2 hours. Weekend approaching (Saturday-Sunday low occupancy 2-3 vehicles vs. weekday 20 vehicles). What factors determine timing and method of emergency response?	Remove immediately regardless of timing - partial failures always imminent hazards requiring urgent action	Close car park until Monday, remove during weekday to avoid weekend road closure complications	Remove Saturday morning during low occupancy using road closure when traffic minimal	Install temporary barrier beneath limb, remove Monday during normal working hours with planned road closure	2	Partial failure (50% torn) = imminent complete failure risk, especially with 40mph gusts forecast. Saturday morning removal: Low car park occupancy (protect few vehicles), weekend traffic lighter (road closure less disruptive), before storm arrival (eliminates wind-loading trigger)	Emergency tree work requires balancing urgency, access logistics, and occupancy patterns.

25	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Horse chestnut avenue (40 trees) with widespread bleeding canker. Survey results: 15 trees severe girdling (60%+ circumference affected), 20 trees moderate girdling (30-60% circumference), 5 trees mild girdling (<30% circumference). Avenue beside busy A-road, all trees overhang carriageway and pavement. Budget allows 10 removals this year. All trees have similar consequence (traffic + pedestrian exposure). How should trees be prioritized when consequences are similar but likelihood varies across population?	Remove 10 trees with worst girdling (top 10 from severe category based on highest percentage circumference)	Remove all 5 mild trees first to save healthiest specimens, then 5 moderate trees	Distribute removals: 5 severe, 5 moderate to address both immediate and medium-term risks	Remove trees at even spacing through avenue to maintain aesthetic character while addressing risk	0	Consequence similar across avenue (all overhang road/pavement). Likelihood varies by girdling extent. Remove highest-likelihood failures first.

26	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Oak, 28m height, DBH 105cm, with cavity and marginally adequate shell (t/R 0.34). Tree overhangs school building 10m away. Building occupied 8am-6pm weekdays during term time (195 days/year). Children use area beneath tree during breaks (30 minutes, 3 times daily). Risk assessment: Possible failure (1 in 10 years probability) × Extreme consequence (potential serious injury/death to children). How does occupancy pattern and target vulnerability affect acceptable risk level?	t/R adequate (>0.30) therefore tree safe regardless of target - retain with standard annual monitoring	Occupancy 195 days = 53% of year, risk reduced proportionally - accept risk during term, monitor during holidays	Children = vulnerable targets requiring highest protection - remove tree despite adequate shell thickness and moderate likelihood	Adequate structure + intermittent occupancy + 10m distance = acceptable risk with quarterly monitoring and contingency removal plan	3	t/R 0.34 marginally adequate but not ideal. Children are vulnerable (can't assess danger, less able to escape). Occupancy intermittent but regular. 10m distance = edge of fall zone. Risk moderate-high despite adequate structure. Quarterly monitoring with removal triggers acceptable vs. precautionary removal	Schools require conservative risk assessment.

27	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Beech, 22m height, DBH 85cm, with Meripilus giganteus at base and root decay. Recent lean development of 6° toward residential property over past 12 months. Pulling test shows progressive movement indicating root plate compromise. Homeowner refuses access for tree removal, disputes tree ownership (boundary dispute ongoing between neighbors). Tree on neighbor's land but threatens subject property. Legal proceedings will take 6+ months minimum. What emergency powers exist and how should imminent risk be managed during legal dispute?	Wait for legal resolution - cannot act on private land without owner permission regardless of risk	Serve Section 23 notice (Local Government Act) requiring neighbor to remove dangerous tree within specified timeframe	Apply for emergency injunction through courts to gain immediate access for removal due to imminent risk	Document risk, notify homeowner in writing of danger, await failure - no legal authority to act on private land	1	Section 23 notice (or equivalent local authority powers) allows requiring removal of dangerous trees on private land. Imminent risk (6° lean progression + pulling test movement) justifies emergency action. Notice specifies timeframe (e.g., 28 days), failure to comply allows local authority removal with cost recovery	Legal frameworks exist to address imminent hazards on private land when owners unresponsive.

28	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Ash, 19m height, DBH 65cm, with advanced ash dieback (70% crown dead). Tree beside sports field used March-October (30 weeks), average 3 sessions per week, 20 people per session. Winter months (22 weeks) field unused. Tree assessment shows high likelihood failure within 12 months. Removal cost same regardless of timing. Does seasonal occupancy variation justify delayed removal to winter, or does high failure likelihood require immediate action?	Seasonal variation irrelevant - high likelihood failure requires immediate removal regardless of occupancy patterns	Delay removal to winter when field unused - eliminates all target exposure during removal operation	Remove immediately - 70% crown dead means branches could fall any time, winter delay unacceptable risk	Remove during next off-season gap (October half-term) to balance urgency and occupancy reduction	2	70% crown dead = extensive dead branches throughout crown (not just crown dieback). Dead branches can fall any time without warning (no seasonal pattern). 30 weeks × 3 sessions × 20 people = 1,800 person-exposures before winter. Cannot accept 8 months of risk exposure	Dead ash fails unpredictably - dead branches drop in calm conditions, whole stems fail suddenly. Ash dieback specifically causes brittle failures.

29	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Ancient oak (450+ years, hollow, Phoenix crown) with t/R 0.19 at narrowest point. Located in historic park, 150m from public access areas. Previous risk assessment accepted high risk due to distance and ecological value (rare saproxylic species habitat). New proposal: forest school 100m from tree, 25 children + 3 staff, 3 days per week during term time. Changed land use brings people significantly closer. How does changed land use affect previously accepted risk, and what mitigation is appropriate?	Previously accepted risk remains valid - 100m still adequate distance, continue annual monitoring	Changed land use requires full re-assessment - remove tree as risk no longer acceptable with closer targets	Partial mitigation: exclude children from 50m radius, create safe zone while retaining tree	Full path diversion required - move forest school to different area 200m+ from tree	2	t/R 0.19 critically inadequate but previously accepted at 150m (remote location). Forest school at 100m = brings vulnerable targets into realistic fall zone (100m for large tree). Cannot remove ancient oak. 50m exclusion zone creates safety buffer while retaining tree at reduced distance	Changed land use requires risk re-evaluation.

30	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Post-storm assessment: 200 trees inspected, 45 show new damage (leans, cracks, hanging branches). Available resources: 2 qualified climbers, 5 working days to address urgent issues before next forecast storm (7 days away). Trees categorized: 8 critical (imminent failure, high consequence targets), 15 high priority (probable failure, moderate consequence), 22 moderate priority (possible failure or low consequence). Weather forecast shows 50mph winds arriving in 7 days. Develop work prioritization schedule considering urgency, resources, and forecast weather.	Work on critical trees only - complete all 8 in 5 days, accept remaining risks until after storm	Address critical and high priority - complete 8 critical plus 10 high priority in 5 days, leave 5 high and 22 moderate	Distribute effort equally - work on trees from all three categories to reduce overall risk across park	Focus on quick wins - remove all 22 moderate priority trees (easier) rather than 8 difficult critical trees	1	8 critical trees require immediate attention (imminent failure + high targets). Climbers can complete ~2 trees per day × 2 climbers × 5 days = 20 trees possible. Prioritize all 8 critical + as many high priority as possible. 50mph storm makes urgent work critical	Storm forecast creates deadline.

31	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Willow, 16m height, DBH 68cm, with Phellinus igniarius and extensive stem decay. Tree has long-established lean of 20° over river (away from bank path). Path located 12m from tree on bank side. Failure would result in tree falling into river away from path - no human targets, potential minor ecological impact from temporary river blockage. Path has moderate pedestrian use. Tree provides shade and amenity along riverbank. Does failure direction away from human targets allow acceptance of higher structural risk?	Failure direction irrelevant - extensive stem decay requires removal regardless of lean orientation	Yes - failure into river eliminates human risk, accept high structural risk with annual monitoring only	Partial acceptance - higher risk tolerable but still monitor quarterly given progressive decay	Remove tree proactively - even failures away from targets create liability exposure	1	20° lean over river = high probability failure direction away from path (12m opposite direction). Failure consequence into river is minimal (no human harm, minor temporary ecological impact). High structural risk acceptable when consequence is minimal	Failure direction is critical risk factor. Trees fail predictably in lean direction (especially established leans with buttressing). If failure cannot reach targets, structural risk becomes less relevant.

Adjacent neighbor (15m away, edge of potential fall zone) concerned about their property being impacted. Can tree owner accept risk that may affect third parties, and what duty of care exists to neighbors?	Tree owner can accept risk for own property - waiver protects against neighbor claims	Tree owner cannot unilaterally accept risk affecting third parties - duty of care extends to neighbors within fall zone	Neighbor concern is insufficient - only remove if risk assessment shows unacceptable level for owner's property	Install barrier fence at boundary to demonstrate risk mitigation attempt, then owner can accept residual risk	1	Tree owner can waive their own risk but cannot waive third-party risk. Neighbor's property at 15m is within fall zone (25m tree + crown). Duty of care extends to foreseeable harm to others.

33	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Beech, 20m height, DBH 76cm, with decay, located on public land overhanging private garden. Public authority completed assessment: Moderate risk, tree to be monitored annually. Homeowner demands removal citing anxiety about tree, property devaluation, and insurance concerns. Tree provides significant public amenity, removal cost £3,200. How should public body balance private concerns against public benefit and actual assessed risk level?	Remove tree - homeowner concerns justify removal even if risk assessment moderate	Retain tree - moderate risk acceptable for public body, homeowner anxiety irrelevant to decision	Offer compromise - crown reduction to reduce loading and homeowner perception of risk	Conduct independent second assessment to validate or challenge original moderate risk rating	1	Public authority owes duty to general public (amenity, canopy cover, ecology) as well as adjacent homeowner. Risk assessment shows moderate (not high) risk. Homeowner anxiety, while understandable, is not a technical risk factor.

Decay extent: 40% of circumference, 60cm vertical extent, brittle fracture likely at decay location. Drop zone includes garden shed (timber, £800 value) and greenhouse (£1200 value). No risk to people as rarely accessed area of garden. Crown reduction would reduce drop zone length, cost £850. Removal cost £2100. How should property-only risk be valued in management decisions when human safety is not a factor?

The most cost-effective option is to monitor the tree annually and accept the moderate risk to your structures. If you're uncomfortable with any risk to these buildings, removal is an option, but it's significantly more expensive than the potential loss.<br><br>If the structures were occupied or people were present, I'd recommend removal regardless of cost.

35	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Avenue of 30 limes, all with included bark co-dominant stems at 4-6m height. Assessment identifies all have moderate to high failure risk at unions. Cost of cabling all 30 trees: £18,000. Cost of crown rebalancing all 30: £12,000. Cost of removing all 30 and replanting: £35,000. Avenue has high amenity and heritage value (120 years old). What risk management strategy balances safety, cost, and amenity when population-wide defects exist?	Cable all 30 trees to eliminate failure risk and preserve full avenue character	Remove worst 10 trees, cable remaining 20, phased approach within budget constraints	Crown rebalance all 30 trees - most cost-effective mitigation maintaining full avenue	Accept moderate risk on all 30, intensive monitoring, remove individual trees only as they deteriorate to high risk	2	Population-wide defect requires phased strategy. Remove worst 10 (£12,000) addresses highest individual risks. Cable remaining 20 (£12,000) = £24,000 total, mitigates moderate risk trees. Phased over 2 years: Year 1 £12k, Year 2 £12k.

36	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Veteran oak (380 years, DBH 165cm) with extensive decay but low structural risk due to reduced height from historic storm-topping 50 years ago (now 12m tall, squat form). Tree in grazed parkland with cattle present. Risk of limb failure onto cattle assessed as low likelihood but moderate consequence (potential animal injury/death, farmer's liability). How should livestock risk be assessed compared to human risk in management decisions?	Livestock risk equals human risk - remove tree to eliminate any possibility of animal injury	Livestock have lower value than humans - accept higher risk threshold than for people	Livestock risk requires economic analysis - compare tree management costs against potential animal loss value	Livestock can be excluded from area - temporary fencing during high-risk periods allows retention	3	Livestock are sentient (welfare concern) but risk can be managed through exclusion. Low likelihood limb failure + ability to exclude cattle = retention justified. Temporary fencing during storms provides mitigation. More flexible than human risk scenarios	Livestock risk differs from human risk: Animals can be relocated/excluded, economic value quantifiable, welfare considerations exist but different from human safety.

37	YES	Risk	SCENARIO: Sweet chestnut (24m height, DBH 98cm) with cavity and marginal shell thickness (t/R 0.29, just below 0.30 threshold) over public footpath. Path is promoted walking route with 200+ users per day in summer, 50 per day in winter. Diversion available adds 800m to route. Tree has high amenity value and is local landmark. What level of risk reduction justifies permanent path diversion versus tree removal?	t/R below threshold requires removal - path diversion cannot justify retaining structurally inadequate tree	Permanent diversion justified - eliminates target exposure while retaining high-value landmark tree	Seasonal diversion (summer only when occupancy high) balances risk and access convenience	Install warning signage only - informed users can choose to accept risk or take diversion	1	t/R 0.29 marginally inadequate but not critically deficient. Diversion eliminates target exposure (consequence = zero). High amenity + local landmark justifies 800m detour inconvenience.

Christmas (2 weeks), Half-terms (1 week each, 6 weeks total) = 16 weeks annually<br>• Select summer or Easter holiday (longer periods, better weather)<br>• Night work: 2am-5am (minimal traffic, 10-20 vehicles/hour vs 50/hour daytime)<br><br>ADVANTAGES:<br>• NO school bus risk (not in operation during holidays)<br>• Minimal traffic disruption (2am-5am = 10-20 vehicles/hour, easily diverted or delayed briefly)<br>• Road closure less impactful (night traffic can wait briefly or take short diversion without significant delay)<br>• Traffic management cost LOWER (simpler setup for night work, fewer vehicles affected)<br>• Safety for workers (less traffic risk)<br><br>DISADVANTAGES:<br>• Premium costs for night work (crew rates 1.5-2× daytime, lighting required)<br>• Tree removal cost: £2,500 daytime vs £4,000-5,000 night (additional £1,500-2,500)<br>• Must wait for next holiday period (max 6 weeks if timing from mid-term)<br>• Weather risk if winter holiday chosen (frozen ground, poor conditions)<br><br>COST COMPARISON:<br>• Daytime removal: £2,500 (tree) + £15,000 (traffic) = £17,500<br>• Night removal (holiday): £4,500 (tree, premium rates) + £5,000 (traffic, reduced scope) = £9,500<br>• SAVINGS: £8,000 (night removal cheaper overall due to reduced traffic management)<br><br>TIMING CONSTRAINT:<br>• High likelihood failure within 2 years = cannot wait indefinitely<br>•

carriageway)<br>• If land opposite road has 28m+ clearance: Directional felling possible<br>• Requires: Skilled feller, favorable lean/weight distribution, no obstacles in fall zone<br><br>ADVANTAGES:<br>• No road closure (traffic continues during felling, brief stop during actual fall)<br>• Minimal disruption<br>• Lower cost (no traffic management)<br>• Can be done immediately<br><br>DISADVANTAGES:<br>• RISK: If felling goes wrong (tree falls toward road), catastrophic consequences (traffic present)<br>• Ash dieback trees often have unpredictable fracture (brittle wood, internal decay)<br>• Directional felling reliability reduced with compromised trees<br>• Professional climber assessment required to determine if safe<br><br>DECISION: Only if highly confident in directional control AND opposite land has clear fall zone AND tree condition allows predictable felling. Otherwise REJECT as too risky.<br><br>RECOMMENDED STRATEGY: Option C (Night removal during school holiday)<br><br>RATIONALE:<br>• Addresses extreme risk promptly (within 6 weeks max)<br>• Eliminates school bus exposure during remaining weeks of term (close tree access if waiting for holiday)<br>• Minimal traffic disruption (night hours, low volume)<br>• Cost-effective (£9,500 vs £17,500 daytime)<br>• Premium night costs justified by safety benefits and overall savings<br>• Acceptable delay (6 weeks max) given high likelihood "within 2 years" (not imminent days/weeks)<br><br>IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:<br>1. Schedule removal during next school holiday (Easter or Summer preferred)<br>2. Night window: 2am-5am (3-hour window, 2 hours work)<br>3. Notify residents in advance (noise from chainsaw, machinery)<br>4. Install temporary barriers on road 100m each side (brief traffic stops during fall, then resume)<br>5. Lighting: Portable floodlights for work area<br>6. Crew: Qualified climbers + ground crew, experienced in night work<br>7. Weather contingency: Backup date if high winds forecast<br>8. School coordination: Inform school of tree removal timing, ensures no early-return activities that week<br><br>INTERIM RISK MANAGEMENT (if waiting 6 weeks):<br>• Inspect tree weekly for rapid deterioration<br>• Install warning signs on road ("Caution - Hazardous tree - Avoid stopping")<br>• Notify school bus company of risk (driver awareness, consider temporary route change if feasible)<br>• Monitor weather forecasts (high winds increase risk, may trigger emergency removal before planned date)<br>• If tree shows signs of imminent failure before holiday: Implement emergency daytime removal despite disruption<br><br>TRAFFIC DISRUPTION PRINCIPLE:<br>Traffic disruption is a significant consideration BUT secondary to safety when vulnerable targets (children) present daily.

What emergency powers allow expedited removal when planning constraints conflict with immediate safety concerns?	No emergency powers exist - must complete 6-week planning process regardless of safety concerns	Serve urgent works notice under Town and Country Planning Act - allows immediate removal for imminent danger	Apply for retrospective planning permission - remove tree immediately, seek permission afterward	Obtain emergency tree work certificate from local tree officer - bypasses planning requirements	1	Urgent works notice (TPO/Conservation Area legislation) allows immediate removal when tree presents imminent danger.

Tree in conservation area requiring planning permission for removal (6-week minimum process). Pulling test shows concerning results indicating root plate compromise. What emergency powers allow expedited removal when planning constraints conflict with immediate safety concerns?	No emergency powers exist - must complete 6-week planning process regardless of safety concerns	Serve urgent works notice under Town and Country Planning Act - allows immediate removal for imminent danger	Apply for retrospective planning permission - remove tree immediately, seek permission afterward	Obtain emergency tree work certificate from local tree officer - bypasses planning requirements	1	Urgent works notice (TPO/Conservation Area legislation) allows immediate removal when tree presents imminent danger.

41	YES	Biomech	A 22m oak has a 180° hollow (north-facing) extending 4.5m vertically. Shell thickness: 85mm (north), 140mm (south). Crown: 70% mass south side due to adjacent building shade from north. No visible cracks. Moderate wind exposure. What is the PRIMARY structural concern requiring immediate assessment?	North shell will fail first due to thinner dimension and compression loading from crown asymmetry	South shell faces higher tension stress despite greater thickness due to eccentric loading and hollow geometry	Lateral torsional failure likely at hollow termination points due to sudden change in cross-sectional properties	Asymmetric crown will cause progressive lean northward, gradually overloading the already compromised north shell	1	When crown mass and decay are on opposite sides, the thicker shell (south) experiences higher tension stress from bending moments caused by eccentric loading - this often counteracts the thickness advantage.	Arborists often assume thicker shells are safer, but eccentric crown loading can reverse this. South shell tension failure is more sudden and complete than north compression failure.	This scenario demonstrates the interaction between decay geometry and loading patterns:<br><br><strong>Biomechanical Analysis:</strong><br>• Crown center of mass: ~3m south of stem centerline<br>• Creates bending moment = crown mass × eccentricity<br>• South shell experiences TENSION (resisting crown pull)<br>• North shell experiences COMPRESSION (resisting crown push)<br><br><strong>Critical Insight:</strong><br>Wood is stronger in compression (~50 MPa) than tension (~35 MPa). The thinner north shell (85mm) in compression may actually be more reliable than the thicker south shell (140mm) in tension when loads are high.<br><br><strong>Shell Thickness Paradox:</strong><br>140mm ÷ 85mm = 1.65× thicker (south)<br>But tension capacity only ~70% of compression<br>Effective safety margin south = 1.65 × 0.7 = 1.15× (minimal advantage)<br><br><strong>Professional Application:</strong><br>• Use pulling tests to measure deflection asymmetry<br>• Tomography should assess BOTH shells thoroughly<br>• Cable installation may need to account for tension-side weakness<br>• Monitor south shell for longitudinal cracks (tension failure warning)	/images/level2/041.svg	Integrates L1: Shell thickness calculations, compression vs tension strength, eccentric loading.

42	YES	Biomech	15m ash, co-dominant union at 3.5m with 60° included bark union. Dynamic cable installed 4 years ago at 80% of union height. Recent inspection shows 85mm vertical crack extending down from union apex, despite cable. Both stems 320mm diameter. Client asks if cable has failed. What is the BEST explanation for crack development despite cabling?	Cable was installed too high (should be 66% of union height max), allowing excessive movement below the cable attachment point	Included bark unions continue accumulating stress over time; cables delay but don't eliminate eventual failure in mature unions	85mm crack represents arrested failure - without the cable the union would have completely separated by now	Dynamic cables allow too much movement; static cables would have prevented crack formation in this high-risk union geometry	2	Cables don't prevent stress accumulation in defective unions - they LIMIT failure propagation. An 85mm crack with cable is arrested failure; without cable, complete separation would likely have occurred.	Clients often view cracking as cable failure, but cables are succeeding if they prevent CATASTROPHIC failure. Understanding this changes monitoring protocols and replacement timing decisions.	This question tests understanding of cable function versus union biomechanics:<br><br><strong>Cable Mechanics:</strong><br>• Cables don't eliminate stress - they SHARE loading<br>• Dynamic cables allow ~2% movement (damping oscillation)<br>• Union still experiences 60-80% of original stress<br>• Stress accumulates over seasons (wind loading cycles)<br><br><strong>Why 85mm Crack Developed:</strong><br>1. Included bark creates stress concentration (45-60° worst case)<br>2. Cable reduces but doesn't eliminate peak stress<br>3. 4 years = ~1,460 days of wind loading cycles<br>4. Crack initiates at apex (highest stress point)<br>5. Cable prevents crack from propagating catastrophically<br><br><strong>Critical Distinction:</strong><br>• Cable FAILURE = complete separation<br>• Cable SUCCESS = controlled, limited cracking<br>• 85mm crack = 26% of 320mm diameter (arrested at ~1/4 depth)<br><br><strong>Professional Response:</strong><br>"The cable is working effectively. Without it, this union would likely have failed completely. The 85mm crack shows stress accumulation, but the cable has arrested its propagation.

43	YES	Biomech	18m beech on 25° slope, stem perpendicular (plumb). Root architecture: upslope roots compressed/thickened, downslope roots in tension. Heavy rain forecast (48hr, 80mm). Soil: clay loam, currently saturated from previous rain. No visible lean increase, but slight recent cracking in upslope root plate. Which biomechanical change poses the GREATEST near-term failure risk?	Saturated soil reduces root anchorage friction by 60-70%, but the root plate architecture will maintain stability through structural engagement	Upslope root compression strength decreases in saturated conditions, while downslope tension roots maintain performance - asymmetric weakening	Saturated clay becomes plastic, allowing slow but progressive lean development that reduces critical buckling height over 48 hours	Additional water weight in crown (estimated 200-300kg) combined with reduced root plate friction creates combined loading increase	1	In saturated soil, compression wood performance degrades significantly (cell buckling) while tension wood maintains strength. This creates dangerous asymmetry in root plate response on slopes.	Trees that appear stable in dry conditions can fail suddenly during saturation because upslope compression roots weaken while downslope tension roots don't compensate adequately - asymmetric root performance.	This scenario requires understanding soil mechanics, root biomechanics, and loading patterns:<br><br><strong>Slope Tree Mechanics (Normal Conditions):</strong><br>• Upslope roots resist compression (tree tries to rotate downslope)<br>• Downslope roots resist tension (pulling against rotation)<br>• System is balanced when both root zones function<br><br><strong>Saturation Effects:</strong><br>Compression Roots (Upslope):<br>• Soil loses bearing capacity (~60-70% reduction)<br>• Lateral root confinement reduced<br>• Compression wood cells more prone to buckling<br>• Performance drops to ~30-40% of dry condition<br><br>Tension Roots (Downslope):<br>• Tension performance relatively maintained<br>• Water doesn't weaken tensile cell structure<br>• Performance remains at ~80-90% of dry condition<br><br><strong>Critical Imbalance:</strong><br>Upslope roots: 30-40% capacity<br>Downslope roots: 80-90% capacity<br>= System failure likely initiates at upslope compression zone<br><br><strong>Warning Signs (Present in Scenario):</strong><br>• Upslope root plate cracking = compression zone overload<br>• Perpendicular stem = maximum bending moment at base<br>• Clay loam = poor drainage, extended saturation	q043_beech_slope_saturation	Integrates L1: Root architecture, soil mechanics, compression vs tension.

44	YES	Biomech	Mature oak, 380mm diameter limb extending 6.5m horizontally ("ram's horn" form) over parking area. Limb weight estimated 1,200kg. Union at 4m height shows 15mm elliptical crack on upper surface. Summer foliage adds ~180kg. Wind loading estimated 250kg lateral at limb end during moderate wind. What is the PRIMARY factor determining failure risk at the union?	The 6.5m lever arm creates ~7,800 Nm bending moment from limb weight alone - far exceeding typical union capacity for this diameter	Summer foliage adds 15% additional weight, but distributed loading reduces effective moment arm compared to end-point loading	Upper surface crack indicates tension failure progression; compression zone at lower surface is still intact and providing primary support	Wind loading (250kg lateral) creates additional ~1,625 Nm moment that, combined with static weight, exceeds union elastic limit	0	Leverage (moment = force × distance) dominates horizontal limb failure risk. The 6.5m arm creates massive bending moment (~7,800 Nm) that typically exceeds union capacity, making static weight alone the critical factor.	Arborists often focus on cracks or wind loading, but the fundamental physics of lever arms means horizontal limbs are inherently overloaded. The moment arm length is usually more critical than crack size or foliage weight.	This question tests quantitative biomechanics understanding:<br><br><strong>Bending Moment Calculation:</strong><br>Moment = Force × Distance<br>≈ 1,200kg × 9.8 m/s² × 6.5m<br>≈ 76,440 N⋅m (76.4 kNm)<br><br><strong>Context for 380mm Union:</strong><br>• Typical oak wood MOR: ~85 MPa<br>• Union capacity with 15mm crack: ~60% of full capacity<br>• Critical moment ≈ 45-55 kNm for this diameter<br>• Current loading (76.4 kNm) EXCEEDS capacity by ~40-70%<br><br><strong>Option Analysis:</strong><br>A - CORRECT: The math shows limb weight alone exceeds capacity<br>B - Foliage adds only ~1,000 Nm (marginal vs 76,400 Nm)<br>C - Crack is SYMPTOM not cause; 15mm is only ~4% of diameter<br>D - Wind adds ~16 kNm (significant but SECONDARY to 76 kNm static)<br><br><strong>Professional Implications:</strong><br>1.

45	YES	Biomech	16m sweet chestnut, elliptical hollow oriented 110°-290° (ESE-WNW). Minor axis (N-S): 140mm shell. Major axis (ESE-WNW): 240mm shell. Site wind rose: prevailing winds from SW (225°), secondary from NE (45°). No other structural defects. Urban park setting. Which wind direction poses the GREATEST structural risk?	SW prevailing winds (225°) align with stronger shell axis (240mm) but higher frequency creates fatigue accumulation	NE secondary winds (45°) load the weaker N-S axis (140mm shell) creating higher peak stress despite lower frequency	ESE winds (110°) create maximum torsional loading as they're tangential to the ellipse's weak axis orientation	Variable winds create cyclic loading alternating between strong and weak axes, preventing adaptive growth response	1	Wind loading perpendicular to an ellipse's weak (minor) axis creates maximum stress in the thinnest shell sections. Even infrequent winds from this direction pose greater risk than frequent winds aligned with strong axes.	Understanding hollow geometry and orientation relative to wind patterns is critical for failure prediction. The weakest structural direction often doesn't align with prevailing wind direction.	This tests three-dimensional geometric understanding of stress distribution:<br><br><strong>Elliptical Hollow Mechanics:</strong><br>• Hollow is oriented ESE-WNW (long axis)<br>• This makes N-S the SHORT axis (weak direction)<br>• Shell thickness: N-S = 140mm, ESE-WNW = 240mm<br>• Ratio: 240÷140 = 1.71× stronger in major axis direction<br><br><strong>Wind Loading Analysis:</strong><br>SW Winds (225°): Loading somewhat oblique, closer to strong axis, shell ~200-220mm<br>NE Winds (45° - CORRECT): Perpendicular to major axis = nearly perfect N-S loading (minor axis), shell thickness 140mm (minimum), section modulus minimum at this orientation<br><br><strong>Stress Calculation Comparison:</strong><br>Stress = Bending Moment / Section Modulus<br>• Section modulus ∝ thickness²<br>• NE loading (140mm shell): Relative stress = 1.0<br>• SW loading (220mm shell): Relative stress ≈ 0.4<br>• NE winds create ~2.5× higher stress despite lower frequency<br><br><strong>Professional Application:</strong><br>• Site assessment must include wind rose analysis<br>• Hollow orientation relative to wind direction is critical<br>• Tomography should prioritize scanning weak axis	q045_chestnut_elliptical_hollow	Integrates L1: Hollow geometry, shell thickness, wind loading.

46	YES	Biomech	Historic pollarded lime, 420mm diameter at 2.5m pollard head. Head has 8 poles (each 180mm diameter) totaling 2,800kg. Central hollow with 45mm shell thickness (t/R = 0.21). Poles create leverage effect with average center of mass 3.2m above pollard head. Next re-pollarding due. What is the BEST management approach considering the marginal shell thickness?	Re-pollard all poles to standard 1.5m length this year to reduce loading moment and prevent shell failure	Remove alternate poles (4 of 8) this year to reduce weight by 50%, then re-pollard remaining poles in 2 years	Delay re-pollarding 2-3 years to allow shell thickening from increased loading stress stimulus	Install cable bracing between pole bases before re-pollarding to reduce moment arm effect on central shell	1	Marginal shell thickness (t/R ~0.21) requires graduated load reduction. Removing alternate poles first reduces weight significantly while maintaining some loading stimulus for shell development, then allows safer re-pollarding of remaining growth.	Sudden dramatic reduction (re-pollarding all poles) can shock a tree adapted to high loading, while doing nothing risks failure. Phased reduction balances safety with physiological adaptation.	This scenario tests understanding of pollard biomechanics and management timing:<br><br><strong>Current Loading Analysis:</strong><br>• 8 poles × 350kg average = 2,800kg<br>• Moment arm: 3.2m above head<br>• Bending moment: ~9,000 kg⋅m<br>• Shell at t/R = 0.21 (threshold of concern: 0.20)<br><br><strong>Management Options Analysis:</strong><br>A - Sudden 70% weight reduction may cause:<br>• Stored energy release (growth hormone imbalance)<br>• Epicormic sprouting explosion<br>• Physiological shock to adapted system<br><br>B - CORRECT: Phased approach:<br>• Remove 4 poles = 50% weight reduction immediately<br>• Reduces moment to ~4,500 kg⋅m (safer range)<br>• Remaining 4 poles maintain loading stimulus<br>• Shell continues thickening under reduced load<br>• 2 years later: re-pollard remaining 4 poles safely<br><br>C - Dangerous: Shell at critical threshold already, delay increases risk<br><br>D - Cables don't address vertical loading from pole weight<br><br><strong>Professional Pollard Management:</strong><br>• Historic pollards adapted to specific loading patterns<br>• Gradual changes allow physiological adjustment<br>• Shell thickening requires continued (but safe) loading stimulus	q046_lime_pollard_shell	Integrates L1: Pollard management, t/R ratios, loading calculations.

47	YES	Biomech	22m oak, mid-height decay pocket at 8m (2.5m vertical extent). Sound wood above and below. Pocket causes 35% reduction in cross-sectional area. Strong prevailing winds. Tomography shows decay confined to pocket zone. No other defects. What is the PRIMARY concern at the decay pocket location?	Stress concentration at upper and lower boundaries where sound wood transitions abruptly to decayed section creates failure initiation points	Reduced cross-section means higher stress throughout pocket zone, with failure likely mid-pocket where decay is most extensive	Wind-induced oscillation amplitude increases at pocket location due to reduced stiffness, creating fatigue failure risk	Decay pocket acts as hinge point, concentrating bending moment and increasing risk of stem snap at this location	0	Abrupt changes in cross-sectional properties create stress concentrations. At decay pocket boundaries, sound wood transitions to reduced section, causing stress spikes that often exceed mid-pocket stress levels.	Failure typically initiates at transition zones, not at the center of defects. This understanding changes where we look for cracks and how we assess decay pockets versus through-defects.

48	YES	Biomech	16m ash, recent 15° lean developed over 18 months. Previously vertical. Root inspection shows: minimal soil mounding, no root plate lifting, asymmetric fine root die-back on lean side. Chalara symptoms in crown. Soil type: heavy clay, no recent ground disturbance. What is the MOST likely cause of lean development?	Progressive root plate failure due to decay (likely Armillaria), with lean direction indicating failure plane orientation	Root death from Chalara ash dieback creating asymmetric anchorage failure, with soil movement prevented by clay cohesion	Crown die-back on one side creating asymmetric loading, causing gradual lean toward heavier remaining crown mass	Subsurface soil movement or cavity causing differential settlement, masked by clay surface cohesion	1	Chalara causes progressive root death alongside crown symptoms. In clay soils, root failure can occur without visible soil movement. Asymmetric root death creates lean without traditional windthrow signs.	Lean without root plate lifting or soil disturbance suggests internal failure (root death/decay) rather than mechanical overload. Understanding cause determines whether lean will continue and failure risk.

49	YES	Biomech	Oak, co-dominant union at 6m with 5mm crack. Dynamic cable installed at 5m (83% of union height). Arborist proposes adding static cable at 3.5m (58% height) to "provide redundancy". Both stems 280mm diameter, union angle 45°. What is the PRIMARY consideration for this proposal?	Lower static cable will create rigid constraint, potentially increasing stress concentration at cable attachment and at the union above it	Two-cable system provides genuine redundancy - if upper cable fails, lower cable prevents catastrophic separation	Static cable at 58% height violates installation guidelines (should be 66-85%), making it ineffective for union support	Lower cable will restrict natural sway movement excessively, preventing adaptive growth response and increasing brittleness	0	Adding a lower static cable creates a rigid constraint that can increase stress concentration at both the cable attachment point and at the union above it. The sudden change from flexible to rigid creates new failure points.	Multiple cables don't always improve safety - they can create new stress concentrations. Understanding how different cable systems interact prevents introducing new failure mechanisms while attempting to improve safety.

50	YES	Biomech	12m willow with 180° hollow (t/R = 0.25) vs 12m oak with 180° hollow (t/R = 0.25). Both trees: identical height, diameter, hollow geometry, wind exposure, no other defects. Site conditions identical. Which statement BEST describes their relative structural risk?	Willow's flexibility allows greater movement under wind loading, dissipating energy and reducing peak stress compared to rigid oak	Oak's denser, stronger wood provides higher absolute strength (MPa), making it structurally superior despite identical geometry	Both species present equal risk - t/R ratio and geometry determine strength, making species-specific properties irrelevant at this scale	Willow's flexibility increases deflection amplitude, creating fatigue risk that may offset its energy dissipation advantage	0	Willow's flexibility (lower E-modulus) allows greater movement that dissipates wind energy before peak stress develops. Despite "looking" more alarming when moving, flexible trees often experience lower peak stresses than rigid trees.	Understanding that movement ≠ danger is critical. Rigid trees can fail suddenly under loads that flexible trees accommodate through increased deflection. Species-specific mechanical properties matter significantly.

51	YES	Biomech	18m beech, major fork at 4m height. Two equal stems (each 240mm diameter). Union angle 35° (included bark present). Wind conditions: prevailing steady winds vs occasional gusty conditions. Storm forecast: sustained 25 m/s with gusts to 35 m/s. What is the MOST significant loading difference between steady vs gusty winds?	Steady winds create consistent stress allowing micro-adaptation, while gusts create peak stresses that exceed elastic limit before adaptation occurs	Gusty winds create alternating loading cycles that accelerate fatigue crack propagation in the included bark union	Steady winds at 25 m/s create higher total energy input than 35 m/s gusts due to longer duration at high speed	Peak gust loads (35 m/s) create 1.96× higher force than steady winds (25 m/s), making instantaneous stress the critical factor	3	Wind force increases with velocity squared (F ∝ v²). A 35 m/s gust creates (35/25)² = 1.96× the force of 25 m/s steady wind. This peak loading difference is the primary structural concern.	Understanding the squared relationship between wind speed and force is critical for risk assessment during storms. A 40% increase in wind speed creates nearly 2× the loading - this often exceeds safety margins.

52	YES	Biomech	14m oak with spiral grain (left-hand spiral, ~15° from vertical). Vertical crack 450mm long developing on south-east face. Tree otherwise sound. Moderate wind exposure. What is the MOST likely crack propagation pattern as failure progresses?	Crack will extend vertically up and down following wood fiber orientation, eventually splitting stem longitudinally	Crack will propagate in spiral pattern following grain direction (downward-left spiral when viewed from above)	Crack will propagate perpendicular to spiral grain, following the path of maximum tensile stress concentration	Spiral grain will prevent crack propagation by redirecting stress, making crack extension unlikely without external loading increase	1	Cracks follow grain direction because wood splits along fibers, not across them. Spiral grain causes cracks to propagate in helical patterns, which can extend around the stem rather than just longitudinally.	Understanding spiral grain crack propagation is critical for failure prediction and rigging operations. Spiral failures can be catastrophic as they compromise more circumference than vertical splits.	This tests understanding of wood anatomy and failure mechanics:<br><br><strong>Wood Fiber Orientation:</strong><br>Normal oak: Fibers run vertically<br>Spiral grain oak: Fibers run at ~15° angle<br>Left-hand spiral: Downward-left when viewed from above<br><br><strong>Crack Mechanics:</strong><br>• Wood is anisotropic (properties vary by direction)<br>• Along grain: Low splitting resistance<br>• Across grain: High splitting resistance<br>• Cracks follow PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE = grain direction<br><br><strong>Spiral Grain Crack Pattern (Option B - CORRECT):</strong><br><br>Current: 450mm vertical crack on SE face<br><br>As failure progresses:<br>1.

Wind exposure identical. Which tree has LOWER failure risk and why?	Oak A - greater height provides better wind load distribution and reduces stress concentration at hollow location	Oak B - squat form (lower H:D ratio) means shorter lever arm, reducing bending moment at base despite same diameter	Both equal risk - identical t/R ratios and exposure mean H:D ratio is irrelevant to structural analysis	Oak A - taller trees develop stronger adaptive growth responses, resulting in more resilient wood properties	1	Lower height-to-diameter ratio means shorter lever arm. Bending moment = force × distance, so Oak B's 12m height creates significantly less moment at base than Oak A's 18m, despite identical wind force on crowns.	Veteran trees with squat proportions (low H:D) are often structurally safer than taller trees with the same trunk diameter and decay. Height creates leverage that amplifies wind loading at the base.

Both have 35% decay at union (tomography confirmed). Wind exposure identical. Which branch poses HIGHER failure risk?	Branch A - steeper angle (20° below horizontal) creates greater shear stress at union despite shorter length	Branch B - additional 1m length creates 33% greater bending moment, outweighing the angle advantage	Both equal - identical diameter and decay percentage mean structural risk is equivalent regardless of geometry	Branch A - steeper angle prevents effective snow and ice accumulation, while Branch B is vulnerable to winter loading	1	Bending moment dominates failure risk in horizontal/near-horizontal branches. Branch B's 4m length vs Branch A's 3m creates 33% more leverage (assuming similar weight distribution), which outweighs the minor angle difference.	Small differences in branch length create significant loading differences due to leverage. A 1m length increase on a 3m branch represents major moment increase that usually exceeds benefits of steeper attachment angles.

Recent heavy snow created 15mm shell opening (vertical split) at top of hollow on east side. Snow melted 3 days ago. What does the shell opening indicate about structural behavior?	Opening developed during loading and will close as wood returns to original position - monitoring for closure rate needed	Opening indicates elastic limit was exceeded; permanent deformation has occurred and gap will remain even without loading	Opening shows stress concentration at hollow termination point, but will close when internal moisture content re-equilibrates	Shell opening represents fatigue crack initiation from repeated loading cycles, indicating progressive failure is beginning	1	Shell opening that persists after load removal indicates the elastic limit was exceeded and plastic deformation occurred. Wood fibers have been permanently separated - the gap won't close without external force.	Persistent deformation after load removal is critical evidence that loading exceeded safe limits.

Independent arboricultural assessment recommends removal within 12 months (high impact, low likelihood = moderate risk). Local authority arboriculturist (your role) must advise planning committee. What is the MOST appropriate professional approach?	Support retention as per planning policy - structural assessment shows tree is within tolerable risk thresholds for the context	Recommend refusal of planning application - tree cannot be safely retained adjacent to proposed habitable structure	Recommend conditional approval with engineered foundation design and 5-year monitoring protocol, documenting residual risk	Advocate for removal regardless of policy - professional duty of care overrides planning considerations when decay is present	2	Professional arborists must balance policy compliance with safety. Conditional approval with engineered solutions and documented risk allows development while managing (not eliminating) tree-related risk within acceptable tolerances.

Avenue is historic landscape feature. £180,000 budget available. Three management approaches proposed. Which represents the BEST long-term strategy?	Phased removal and replacement with horse chestnut (disease-resistant cultivars) over 8 years - maintains species character and historic authenticity	Remove all diseased trees and replant with mixed native species (oak, lime, beech) - improves resilience and eliminates species-specific disease risk	Retain existing avenue with intensive 5-year health management program (injection treatments, pruning) - preserves mature character during treatment development	Remove and replace with single alternative species (London plane) - maintains avenue uniformity while eliminating horse chestnut disease issues	1	Mixed species planting improves resilience against future pests/diseases while still providing avenue structure.

58	YES	Management	Woodland site: 8,000 ash trees (mixed ages), 95% showing Chalara ash dieback symptoms. Safety-critical areas: 2 car parks (150 trees), 5km footpath network (800 trees), visitor center (50 trees). Budget: £85,000 Year 1, £45,000 annually thereafter. Site must remain open to public. What is the MOST defensible 5-year management strategy?	Year 1: Remove all 1,000 high-risk trees (paths/facilities). Years 2-5: Monitor and remove symptomatic woodland trees as they become hazardous	Year 1: Close site, remove 500 highest-risk trees. Years 2-5: Phased removal working outward from facilities, reopening sections as cleared	Year 1: Remove 200 critical trees, close paths beneath remaining 800. Years 2-5: Systematic survey and removal program, reopening paths as cleared	Year 1-2: Remove all 1,000 infrastructure trees plus 500 woodland. Years 3-5: Accept woodland trees will become hazardous, exclude public from woodland	2	Limited budget requires prioritization. Removing immediate critical risks while closing unsafe areas allows continued partial access. Systematic clearance then reopens areas progressively as resources allow.

59	YES	Management	Veteran oak (estimated 380 years old), t/R 0.24, significant ecological value (14 bat roosts, nesting birds, 200+ invertebrate species). Located beside school playing field, used daily. Remaining safe useful life estimated 15-25 years. Current ecological value significantly exceeds what a replacement tree would provide for 100+ years. What principle should PRIMARILY guide the management decision?	Prioritize ecological value - veteran's irreplaceable biodiversity contribution outweighs manageable structural risk in this timeframe	Prioritize safety - children's welfare is paramount and trumps ecological considerations regardless of probability levels	Balance approach - retain tree with 25m exclusion zone from playing field, preserving both ecology and safety	Economic analysis - quantify ecological value vs accident cost/probability to determine evidence-based management approach	2	Neither absolute ecology priority nor absolute safety priority is professionally appropriate. Risk-based spatial management (exclusion zones) can often preserve both ecological and safety interests.	Veteran tree decisions require balanced professional judgment.

Developer proposes removing all 20 in construction zone, offering £30,000 commuted payment for off-site planting. You're the LPA tree officer. What is the MOST appropriate response?	Accept proposal - £30,000 off-site planting will deliver more trees than 12 retained on-site, providing greater public benefit	Refuse proposal - 12 trees can be retained with design changes, and developer should bear reasonable costs to avoid harm	Negotiate compromise - accept removal of worst 6 trees in construction zone, require design changes to retain other 6	Require retention of all 12 - design changes costing £45,000 are reasonable for mature tree retention and precedent-setting	1	Planning principle: developers should avoid harm where reasonably practicable. £45,000 cost to retain 12 mature trees (£3,750/tree) is generally reasonable.

61	YES	Management	School site: 80 mature trees in various conditions. Annual inspection budget: £8,000. Three proposals: (A) Inspect all 80 trees annually at £100/tree (£8,000); (B) Risk-based regime - 20 high-risk trees 3×/year, 60 low-risk trees 1×/year (£9,000 - overspend by £1,000); (C) Visual assessments only, all trees annually, internal staff (£0 additional cost). Head teacher asks for recommendation. What is the MOST professionally defensible approach?	Option A - annual inspection of all trees maintains duty of care consistently and stays within budget	Option B - risk-based approach is professionally superior, recommend finding £1,000 additional budget or deferring some low-risk inspections to alternate years	Option C - visual assessments by trained staff are adequate for most trees, with external inspection for flagged concerns only	Option A but recommend reducing inspection detail to allow budget for more frequent high-risk tree assessment	1	Risk-based inspection regimes are professionally superior to uniform approaches. High-risk trees require more frequent assessment. The £1,000 overspend (12.5% over budget) is justified by safety improvement and should be advocated for.

62	YES	Management	Oak (320mm diameter) with TPO and moderate decay (t/R 0.27, Inonotus dryadeus confirmed). Tree is within development site boundary. Developer claims tree makes plot unviable, offers £8,000 compensation for removal. Independent viability assessment confirms plot is economically marginal with tree, viable without. Planning policy strongly favors retention. You're the LPA case officer. What is the MOST defensible decision?	Refuse TPO consent - planning policy strongly favors retention, and tree is not in critical structural condition requiring removal	Grant consent with conditions - require 2:1 replacement planting on-site and £8,000 paid to public tree planting fund	Defer decision - require developer to explore design alternatives (smaller building, plot reconfiguration) before considering removal	Grant consent - development viability concerns outweigh TPO protection when independent assessment confirms economic impacts	2	TPO applications for development should explore all retention options first. Deferring to require design alternatives tests whether removal is truly unavoidable before accepting viability arguments.	TPO decisions must test "necessity" claims rigorously.

63	YES	Management	Woodland site (12 hectares), mixed native species, high deadwood volumes (8-10 standing dead trees/hectare = ~100 total). Public access throughout. Current policy: remove standing deadwood over paths, retain elsewhere. Ecology survey: deadwood is supporting exceptional invertebrate diversity (42 saproxylic species including 3 Red Data Book species). Annual deadwood removal budget: £18,000. Conservation officer proposes ceasing all removal to maximize biodiversity. What is the MOST appropriate management policy revision?	Cease deadwood removal woodland-wide - ecological value outweighs manageable safety risk in low-intensity public access woodland	Continue current policy - removing deadwood over paths balances safety and ecology, retaining 90%+ of habitat	Implement zoned approach - create 2-hectare "conservation zones" (no access, no removal) while maintaining safety management in accessible areas	Increase removal to include all standing deadwood within 50m of paths - expanding safety buffer while retaining core woodland deadwood	2	Zoned management can optimize both ecology and safety.

66	YES	Management	Local authority manages 2,400 roadside trees. Recent incident (branch failure injured pedestrian, £180k settlement) prompts policy review. Legal team proposes: "Remove any tree with observable defect within 10m of highway." This would affect ~600 trees. Arboricultural team (your department) must respond. What is the MOST professionally appropriate position?	Support removal policy - legal liability from tree-related incidents exceeds value of retaining defective trees in high-risk locations	Oppose policy - observable defects don't indicate unacceptable risk; professional assessment determines removal necessity, not blanket policies	Propose compromise - enhanced inspection regime (biannual) for roadside trees with defects, with removal only when risk exceeds tolerable thresholds	Propose alternative - accept legal team's concern but define "observable defect" through professional criteria (e.g., t/R <0.25, major crack >30% diameter) to prevent arbitrary removal	3	Blanket removal policies based on "observable defect" are professionally indefensible and likely unlawful. Professional response should acknowledge legal concerns while establishing evidence-based criteria that distinguish genuine risk from minor defects.	Single incidents often trigger over-reactions.

68	YES	Management	Urban park, proposal to remove 12 mature trees (oak/lime/ash) for new community facility. Trees are healthy (BS5837 Category A/B).

Planning officer asks for arboricultural input. What should PRIMARILY guide your professional advice?	Public sentiment - 80% opposition demonstrates community values trees more than facility, supporting refusal	Arboricultural assessment - Category A/B trees have high value; removal should only be permitted if no design alternatives exist	Community benefit analysis - quantify facility benefits vs tree amenity value to determine greater public interest	Planning policy compliance - assess whether proposal aligns with local plan tree retention policies and development plan	1	Arboricultural input should focus on technical assessment: tree quality and whether design alternatives exist to retain them.

69	YES	Management	Borough manages 8,500 street trees (80% London plane, 15% lime, 5% mixed). Climate projections: 2°C increase by 2050, 15% rainfall reduction, increased drought/heat stress. Two strategies proposed: (A) Proactive replacement - remove 1,500 older planes over 15 years, plant climate-resilient species (£2.1M); (B) Reactive management - retain existing trees until failure/death, then replace with resilient species (£900k over 15 years). Which approach is MORE defensible professionally?	Proactive replacement - climate adaptation requires anticipatory action; waiting for failure loses canopy cover during transition period	Reactive management - existing planes provide current ecosystem services; premature removal destroys functional assets and wastes embodied carbon	Proactive replacement - establishes climate-adapted forest before crisis hits; reactive approach risks catastrophic canopy loss if plane decline is sudden	Hybrid approach - identify worst-condition 500 planes for proactive replacement, retain 7,000 healthy trees on reactive basis, balancing adaptation urgency with asset conservation	3	Climate adaptation requires balance between proactive action and asset conservation. Hybrid approach targets genuinely declining trees while retaining healthy stock, reducing costs and canopy disruption while still advancing adaptation.	Neither wholesale replacement nor pure reactive approaches optimize across climate adaptation, financial sustainability, and canopy continuity. Risk-based targeting identifies trees most vulnerable to climate stress for proactive replacement.

70	YES	Management	County council, 250 high-value trees (veteran oaks, ancient parkland). Initial survey complete. Budget available: £85,000 for follow-up work over next 2 years. Survey identified: 35 trees requiring urgent intervention (removal/major works within 6 months); 75 trees requiring routine maintenance (crown reduction, deadwood removal within 18 months); 140 trees requiring monitoring only (annual inspection). How should budget be PRIORITIZED?	Spread equally - allocate £340/tree uniformly to ensure all trees receive some investment	Urgent first - allocate 70% (£59.5k) to 35 urgent trees, defer routine work until future budgets secured	Risk-based allocation - urgent trees get priority, then routine work with remaining budget, monitoring trees on inspection-only regime	Ecological value - prioritize veteran trees regardless of structural condition, as these have irreplaceable biodiversity value	2	Risk-based budget allocation prioritizes urgent safety work, then funds routine maintenance with remaining budget. Monitoring-only trees are adequately served by inspection regime without immediate works budget.	Budget allocation should follow risk hierarchy: address hazards first (duty of care), then maintenance (asset preservation), then monitoring (surveillance).

71	YES	Integrated	Oak, 18m tall, 520mm diameter. Recent construction damaged roots on north side (3m from stem, 25% RPA affected). Ganoderma adspersum fruiting body appeared south side 6 months post-construction. Crown shows 15% dieback (north side). Lean developed 8° toward south (previously vertical). Site: school boundary, tree overhangs playground. What is the PRIMARY concern driving management decisions?	Root damage has compromised anchorage, and southward lean indicates progressive root plate failure requiring urgent removal	Ganoderma indicates pre-existing decay; construction stress has accelerated decline, requiring removal within 6 months before failure risk increases	Integration of factors: root damage + decay + lean + dieback creates compounding failure risk that exceeds individual risk assessments	Construction damage liability: contractor responsible for tree decline, removal costs should be recovered through legal action before addressing safety	2	When multiple stressors interact (root damage + decay + lean + dieback), the combined effect often exceeds the sum of individual risks. Integrated assessment recognizes that stressed trees with decay progress faster toward failure.	Single-factor analysis misses interaction effects. Root damage alone might be tolerable; decay alone might be manageable; but combined they create accelerated failure progression requiring more urgent intervention than either factor alone.

72	YES	Integrated	Beech avenue (22 trees, 80 years old), field maple hedge boundary adjacent. Avenue shows gradient of symptoms: Trees 1-6 (west end): healthy; Trees 7-14 (middle): moderate crown thinning, small necrotic leaf spots; Trees 15-22 (east end): severe dieback (40-60%), bleeding stem lesions, Phytophthora root samples positive. Hedge shows similar east-to-west pattern. Site: gentle slope (east higher), clay soil, new drainage installed east end 18 months ago. What is the MOST likely diagnosis and primary management priority?	Phytophthora spreading west from east-end introduction; priority is treating infected trees and preventing further spread through hygiene protocols	Drainage installation has created waterlogging gradient (water flows east to west downslope), Phytophthora is opportunistic on waterlogged trees; priority is drainage correction	Site gradient indicates Phytophthora source at east (high) end with water-mediated spread downslope; priority is identifying and eliminating infection source then managing drainage	Natural stress gradient (east end exposure to prevailing weather); Phytophthora is secondary infection; priority is reducing stress through irrigation and crown management	2	Phytophthora spread requires water movement and infection source. Site gradient + drainage installation + symptom pattern suggest water flows from infected east end (upslope) westward, carrying pathogen. Management must address both source and drainage.	Disease diagnosis requires understanding site hydrology, pathogen biology, and symptom progression patterns. Phytophthora cases often involve drainage issues creating pathogen movement corridors; fixing drainage without eliminating source allows reinfection.

73	YES	Integrated	Ancient oak (estimated 420 years old), parkland setting. Symptoms developed over 3 years: progressive dieback (now 45%), Armillaria rhizomorphs discovered at base, Ganoderma adspersum fruiting body on major root, Inonotus dryadeus on stem base (all confirmed). Tomography shows 35% root decay, stem base t/R = 0.29. Veteran tree assessment: exceptional ecological value (bat roosts, 180+ invertebrate species). Tree is 45m from public footpath (moderate use). What management approach BEST balances competing values?	Remove immediately - multiple fungal pathogens indicate terminal decline; retaining creates unacceptable risk given footpath proximity	Retain with annual monitoring - ecological value is exceptional and irreplaceable; risk is manageable with surveillance and path modification if needed	Phased crown reduction (30% over 2 years) - reduce loading while maintaining structure, extend safe retention period, preserve maximum ecological value	Accept natural decline - exclude public access 50m radius, allow tree to progress to standing deadwood (maximum biodiversity value over decades)	3	Ancient trees with multiple pathogens often decline slowly over decades. Phased crown reduction reduces loading, extends safe retention, and preserves structure for ecological function longer than either removal or unmanaged decline.	Multiple pathogens don't always equal immediate failure. Veteran tree management requires understanding decline timelines and using structural intervention to extend retention while managing risk - not binary remove/retain choices.

74	YES	Integrated	Horse chestnut avenue, 35 trees, 75 years old. Symptoms: 28 trees (80%) with bleeding canker (Pseudomonas); 20 trees (57%) with leaf miner damage (Cameraria); 15 trees (43%) with Guignardia leaf blotch. Overlap: 12 trees have all three stressors. Avenue condition: Trees with single stressor = fair/moderate; Trees with two stressors = poor; Trees with three stressors = severe decline (40-60% dieback). Avenue is historic landscape feature. Budget: £65,000. Three proposals: (A) Remove all 28 canker trees, plant mixed species (£42,000 removal + £23,000 planting); (B) Remove 12 worst (triple-stressed) trees only, intensive management of others (£18,000 removal + £15,000 treatment + £12,000 planting); (C) Remove all 35 trees, fresh start with disease-free species (£52,000 removal + £35,000 planting = £87,000, seek additional £22,000). What is the MOST defensible strategy?	Option A - bleeding canker is terminal; removing infected trees prevents spread and establishes replacement cohort within budget	Option B - targets genuinely terminal trees (triple-stressed) while attempting to maintain avenue character and manage recoverable trees	Option C - despite budget overage, complete removal prevents ongoing disease pressure and eliminates future risk	Modified Option B - remove 12 triple-stressed plus 8 worst double-stressed (20 total), retain 15 best trees, within budget with better long-term prognosis	3	Stress triage: Trees with triple stressors are terminal; double-stressed trees are poor candidates; single-stressed trees may be manageable. Removing 20 worst (triple + worst doubles) focuses resources on trees with recovery potential while staying in budget.	Multiple stress factors have compounding effects. Triage requires assessing which trees are genuinely saveable vs terminal. Partial retention strategies must honestly evaluate recovery likelihood, not preserve doomed trees.

75	YES	Integrated	Ash woodland, 8 hectares, 850 trees. Chalara ash dieback present 5 years, now 90% symptomatic. Site survey identified: 45 trees with Armillaria (often co-occurring with Chalara); 28 trees with both Chalara and Kretzschmaria deusta (brittle decay); 180 trees with advanced Chalara (70%+ dieback); 370 trees moderate Chalara (30-60% dieback); 227 trees early Chalara (<30% dieback). Site has 3km footpath network (high use), car park (150 daily visitors), educational outdoor classroom. 5-year budget: £120,000. Consultant proposes: "Year 1-2: Remove all advanced + dual pathogen trees (253 trees, £75k). Years 3-5: Monitor and remove moderate Chalara as they progress (estimated 200 trees, £60k). Close paths beneath remaining trees." Local authority proposes: "Create 2 hectare 'safe zones' (remove all trees), maintain access there. Close remaining 6 hectares, let natural dieback occur." What is the MOST professionally defensible strategy?	Consultant plan - systematic removal of highest-risk trees maintains partial access while managing risk, uses full budget for maximum tree removal	Local authority plan - safe zones provide guaranteed access, natural process zones maximize future deadwood ecology, realistic about budget limits	Modified consultant plan - Remove 253 highest-risk trees (Years 1-2), but prioritize keeping 1.5km primary paths open, accept closure of secondary paths, reassess Year 3 based on progression and budget	Hybrid approach - Create 1 hectare safe zone (total clearance) for car park/classroom, remove highest-risk trees along primary paths only (100 trees), close secondary areas, monitor and adapt	3	Chalara creates resource demands exceeding any realistic budget. Modified consultant plan addresses immediate high risks, prioritizes primary access routes, and builds in reassessment flexibility as outbreak progresses.	Ash dieback management requires accepting that complete access maintenance is impossible. Strategic triage - protect primary access, remove highest risks first, close secondary areas, reassess regularly - is more sustainable than attempting comprehensive treatment or complete closure.
